    "transcript": "All [Music] right, welcome to SpaceX. Uh, here we are in the lobby. It's very white right now, but there are actually some some cool uh elements coming in soon that will make it less white. In the front of the building, we have our engineering offices and and space for about 300 people per floor. And we've got a total of about three floors that we can open. Right now, only the first floor is occupied. Um we try to aim for something which is a very open plan uh to maximize communication and make it sort of you know fairly nicel looking. Uh this place used to be quite dismal. That's that's my office over there. Actually we really try to minimize the number of offices that we have because doors limit communication. Everyone at the company with the exception of a few people in like HR and finance actually um are in cubes uh including your vice presidents over there. There's Gwen at her cube. Um, I should have cleaned up if I were coming. Although this is really reality, I guess. I'm responsible for sales. I'm in charge of uh making sure that there's revenue here in the company and we're working on lots of Falcon 1 deals, Falcon 9 deals, and Dragon deals. So, this is just a little area where people can meet and um and have sort of an impromptu meeting. Um, obviously also very open. Um, I think it's actually quite helpful to have this openness because then you can sort of see what people are working on in their computers. Um like what Matt McCun here is is doing. Um what are you working on there? Uh I'm making a uh assembly documentation for the uh Draco. Okay. RCS. David is is driving the development of our inspace thruster which is called Draco. Um and um there's a little piece of it or that's just a temp that's just a sample spun cone. Yeah. So yeah, we're doing all our Texas testing at our facility down there. We got a new vacuum system. So kind of going back and forth between there kind of progress along. Right. So this the direct engine is what is used in our Dragon spacecraft and also in the upper stage of of Falcon 9 for orbital maneuvering and re-entry. This is uh our meeting room, VIP meeting room for uh when we meet with our customers and um if a CEO of a customer comes through or something like that. It's kind of cool because it's got this glass that um that goes opaque and we put a motion sensor on it. So as you walk in the glass goes opaque. We we named our copper frames after the great um rocket engineers and great scientists related to space. So we think they they really deserve the credit for you know enabling us to become a space fairing civilization. So we're fairly um science and engineering centric. Um we have some some conference rooms named after astronauts too but but we try to focus more on the the people that actually designed and built the rocket.",

    "transcript": "[Applause] Yeah, there you go. All right. The gateway to Mars. So, here we are. Here we are at uh at the newly incorporated Starbase, Texas. [Applause] This is uh the first new city made in America in I think quite a few decades. Uh that uh at least that's what I'm told. And uh very cool name and it's named that because it is the it is where we're going to develop the technology necessary to take uh humanity uh and civilization and and life as we know it to another planet for the first time in the 4 and a half billion year history of Earth. [Applause] So go with this little video here. This is how it started off with basically nothing. So start stra started off as basically a sandbar with nothing. Even those little things we built obviously [Music] That's the original sort of MadMax rocket. This is where you discover light. Light lighting is very important for that Mad Max rocket. So, yeah, not that long ago, there was basically nothing here. And in the space of about five or six years, uh, thanks to the incredible work of the SpaceX team, uh, we've built a small city, uh, and we've built, uh, two a gigantic launch pads and a gigantic rocket factory for a gigantic rocket. Um, so and the cool thing is for anyone out there who's watching this, uh, you can actually come and visit, uh, because our entire production facility and launch site are on a public highway. Um, so anyone comes who comes to South Texas, um, can come and see the rocket pretty close up and see the factory. And um so anyone who's interested in seeing the largest flying object on Earth can come here anytime they want and just drive down the public highway and see it, which is pretty cool. So then we progress to where we are now, Starbase 2025. So, we're we're now at the point where we can produce a ship roughly every 2 or 3 weeks. Now, we we don't always produce a ship every 2 or 3 weeks because we are making design upgrades. Um, but ultimately, we're aiming for the ability to produce a,000 ships a year. So, three ships a day. So, that's where things are now. I'm standing in that building. That's our hovercraft. We're driving booster down the road to the uh launch site. You can see the mega bays. And as I said, what's cool the cool thing for those out out there watching this video is that you can actually just literally come here, drive down the road and see it, which is the first time in history that that's been possible. So all this cool stuff you that that that road on the left there, that highway is public and you can just come here and see it, which I recommend doing. I think it's very inspiring to see. So that's our gigaby. So we're where we're expanding integration to produce a thousand starships per year. Well, yeah, that hasn't been built yet, but we're building it. Um, that is a truly enormous structure. This will be one that'll be one of the biggest structures, I think, by some measures, the biggest structure in the world. And it's designed for a thousand starships a year. We're also building a gigabay in Florida bringing so we'll have uh two facilities, one in Texas and one in Florida. It's it's actually difficult to gauge the tr the size of these buildings because you need a kind of human for scale. When you see how tiny a human is next to that building, you realize just how enormous it is. So when we look at uh our bullet comparison vehicles per year um and uh so you look at Boeing and Airbus making uh airplanes uh Starship making will be making at some point probably as many starships for Mars as uh Boeing and Airbus make commercial airplanes. So this is really at a scale enormous scale and each starship uh will have a capability uh it's it's each starship is bigger than a 747 or an A380 like it's truly enormous. Uh and then in terms of uh Starship Starlink satellites, the version 3 satellites making on the order of 5,000 a year, maybe at some point closer to 10,000 a year. And those uh Stallink V3 satellites are uh each the size of roughly a 737. They're pretty big. That compares to the B24 bomber in World War II. Now it's still small compared to Tesla. Um so and Tesla will probably doing you know um double or triple that volume in the future. So it just puts things into perspective that is it is actually possible to build uh a vast number of uh interplanetary starships. Um, and even when you can compare things on on the tonnage standpoint, Tesla is still and and other car companies are still building far more complex manufacturer tonnage uh than than SpaceX, which is really is a way of saying that uh it's very achievable like the these numbers while they are insanely high by traditional space standards are are uh are achievable by humans because they have been achieved in other industries. Progress is measured by the timeline to establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. That's how we're gauging our progress here at Starbase. So, with each launch, especially in the early days of of Starship, each launch is about learning more and more about what's needed to make life multilanetary um and to improve Starship to the point where it can be taking ultimately hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people to Mars. Ideally, we can take anyone who wants to go to Mars, we can take to Mars um and bring with bring all of the equipment necessary to uh make Mars self-sustaining uh so Mars can grow by itself uh in a worst case scenario. uh getting to the point where uh the fundamental fork in the road for human destiny is where um we where Mars can continue to grow even if the the supply shifts from Earth stop coming for any reason. At that point uh we've achieved civilizational uh resilience uh where um Mars can potentially come to the rescue of Earth if something goes wrong or maybe Earth could come to the rescue of Mars. But we but having two planets that are that are that can that that are both self- sustaining um and strong um I think is going to be incredibly important for the long-term survival of civilization. Um, so like just I think any given civilization is likely to last maybe I don't know 10 times longer, maybe much longer if it is a multilanet civilization than if it is a single planet civilization because there always there's always some chance that uh you know us humans could do something crazy like World War II. Hopefully not, but it's possible. um or that there could be some uh natural event like uh meteors or super volcanoes or something that we don't expect and uh and and then if we only have one planet then that that could be curtains but if we got two planets uh we keep going and and then we go beyond Mars ultimately to um the moon maybe the asteroid belt the moons of Jupiter and beyond and ultimately to other star systems and we can be out there among the stars making science fiction no longer fiction. So in order to achieve this goal we have to be we have to make rapidly reusable rockets so that the uh the cost per flight the cost per ton to Mars is as low as possible. Uh that's essential. So that for that rapidly reusable rockets I said we could it's actually four Rs. It's like a pirate R. It's like rapidly reusable reliable rockets is the key. R Now we've uh congrats to the SpaceX team on making incredible progress on catching a giant rocket. [Applause] So, it's really mind-blowing that the SpaceX team has been able to catch the largest flying object ever made multiple times using a very novel method of catching it out of the air with giant chopsticks. [Music] I mean, have you ever seen that before? Yeah, congrats again. That was an incredible achievement. [Applause] So the the the the reason we are uh catching it in this way which is uh never been done before is in order to achieve the rapidly reusable portion of the in order to make the rocket rapidly reusable. So if it is if if if if the super heavy booster which is gigantic uh it's like 30 ft in diameter um if if if it were to land with landing legs on a landing pad we would then have to uh pick it up uh stow the legs uh and put it back in the launch pad. Um and that's uh it's quite difficult to transport such a large thing. Um but if we catch it with the same tower that it's used to put it in the uh launch uh mount to begin with that that is the best case outcome for rapid reuse. So it literally gets caught uh by the same arms that placed it in the launch uh in launch ring and then it is placed back in the launch ring immediately. So in principle the super heavy booster can be refflown within an hour of uh landing. So it it comes back in about five or six minutes one way or another and and then it it gets caught by the tower arms placed back in the launch mount and then you can re refill propellant in about 30 to 40 minutes and and place a ship on top of it and in principle refly the entire booster uh every hour maybe every two hours to be give a little bit of extra time. Um, but let's just say it's it's very it's in the limit of rapid reuse. And then we the next thing we need to do is is catch the ship too. So, we haven't done this yet, but we will. So, that's what we hope to demonstrate later this year, maybe as soon as 2 or 3 months from now. And then the the ship would be placed on top of the booster and then again uh re re refilled with propellant and flown again. Um with the ship takes a bit longer because it's got to orbit Earth a few times until the ground track comes back over the launch pad. Uh but it the ship is also intended to be refflowing multiple times per day. This is the uh the new Raptor 3 which is an awesome engine. Big hand to the Raptor team for this. This is very exciting. [Applause] So, Raptor 3 uh is designed to require no basic heat shield uh saving a lot of mass on the bottom and actually improving reliability so that uh if if there is for example um a small fuel leak uh from the Raptor engine uh it will simply leak uh into the existing flaming plasma and um not really matter. Whereas a a fuel leak when the engines are contained in a box uh is a very scary thing indeed. So this is a Raptor 3 uh might it'll take probably a few kicks at the can but it will be is a massive increase uh in payload capability uh in engine efficiency uh and in reliability. So this is really a revolutionary engine. Um, you know, Raptor 3 is really, I'd say, kind of alien technology rocket engine. I mean, even industry experts when we showed a picture of the Raptor 3 said that engine is not complete. So, then we said, well, here's the engine not complete, firing uh at a level of efficiency that has never been achieved before. So, [Applause] I mean that is one clean engine. So in order to make the engine like that we had to simplify so many parts of the design incorporate uh secondary fluid circuits and electronics in the structure of the engine itself. U so everything is contained and protected. uh it is uh a marvel of engineering frankly. Then one of the other technologies that's key for Mars is is uh doing orbital propellant transfer. So you can think of this like similar to aerial refueling for airplanes uh but in this case it's orbital refilling of rockets which has never been done before. Uh but it is you know technically feasible. Um I always feel like these things are a little NSFW sort of listen you got to transfer fluid somehow. There's no this has got to be done. So uh the the the two starships would get together and one starship would transfer fuel and oxygen and actually most of the mass is oxygen. It's almost 80% oxygen that gets transferred. Um, a little over 20% fuel. And um, and so on you you so you send a starship to orbit with that's full of payload and then you send a bunch of other starships up and you would refill the propellant on that starship and once the the propellant tanks are mostly full then you can depart for the Mars for Mars or the moon or Yeah. So this is an important technology which uh we should hopefully uh demonstrate next [Applause] year. So then with the uh one of the toughest problems to solve is the uh reusable heat shield. Um so so no no one has ever developed a truly reusable orbital heat shield. So the that it's extremely difficult to do so. Um even the the shuttle shuttle's heat shield required several months of refurbishment. Basically fixing broken tiles um testing each tile and um because it's an extremely hard problem uh to to be able to withstand the extreme heat and pressure of re-entry. Um and uh the only things that that can really withstand this level of heat are uh advanced sort of ceramics uh kind of uh you know basically glass, aluminum uh some types of of uh carbon carbon but very very little actually can survive the uh and with with reusability without getting without eroding um or falling off or cracking. can survive the stresses of re-entry. Um, so this will be the first time uh that it's done that that that a reusable orbital heat shield is developed. Um, and it needs to be obviously extremely reliable. Um, so this this will be something that we'll be working on for a few years, I think, to to keep honing the the heat shield. Um, it's it's a very it's it's it is an achievable thing. So we're not trying to do something that isn't achievable. It is within the realm of physics to get this done. Just an extraordinarily difficult thing to get done. And Mars uh the Mars atmosphere is carbon dioxide, which at first may seem better, but actually it ends up being worse because it it when the CO2 turns into a plasma and you've got you actually end up with more free oxygen entering on a Mars atmosphere than on Earth atmosphere. So Earth's atmosphere is only around 20% um oxygen and Mars ends up being basically more than double that maybe triple that um when you consider when the the CO2 becomes a plasma and uh and you and you get carbon and O2. So the that wants to oxidize the heat shield basically burn the heat shield. So that's why we uh we tested very rig rigorously in a CO2 atmosphere because it's got to work not just for Earth but also for Mars. Um and and we we want we want to use the same heat shield for Earth that we use for Mars because there are many other factors with the heat shield uh such as making sure the tiles don't crack or fall off or anything like that. Um, so we want to have the same heat shield structure, same material on Earth as on Mars. So we can test it uh hundreds of times on Earth before going to Mars and be confident that when it goes to Mars, it will work. So we developing some next generation starships which are have a number of improvements uh versus our current gen. So uh it's taller for example and has a a better inter kind of a the interstage between the ship and the booster. You can see that sort of um the the sort of struts there that makes it easier for the flame ah like that right there. Um when doing hot staging, which is when we light the ship's engines while the booster's engines are still firing, the the flame from the um from the ship engines can more easily exit through the uh the open struts of the of the new interstage. And in this case, we'll bring the the struts interstage back with us instead of throwing it away. So, a little more height here. Uh 72 m from around 69. Uh repellent capacity, I think we'll probably push that up a little, maybe 3,700 tons. Um long term, my guess is we're maybe around 4,000 tons. and about just sort of just over 8, you know, sort of uh 8,000 probably like 8,000 300. This will keep getting up. My guess is ultimately we're 4,000 tons here, close to 10,000 tons of thrust, but this is kind of the next uh the next level or the next version of the Super Heavy. Uh, so the booster will look a little naked on the bottom because the the Raptor 3 engines don't require a heat shield. So it look like it looks like there's kind of parts missing, but that's just because the the Raptor heat shield uh does not the the Raptor 3 does not need a heat shield. So it's just it's just standing there there in a bathed in flaming plasma. But it's a lot lighter. Yep. Integrated hot stage. I think it looks amazing. And then the shift's a little little more little longer, a little more capable. Um moving to 1550 tons of propellant capacity. Um, and my guess is this probably ends up 20% more than this long term. Um, and uh, yeah, you can see it the the heat shield is sleeker. So much smoother boundaries as as the the boundary of the the heat shield going to the leeward side uh is is very smooth. Um, no more jagged tiles. I think it looks very sleek. Uh so and this version we still have six engines but a future version will have nine. Uh but with the Raptor 3 again we have improved um uh uh reduced mass higher um specific impulse. Um it's this is the the Starship version 3 is really the it the version that is I think achieves all of the the key elements. I mean generally with any new technology it takes three major uh three major iterations of any major techn of any new technology to have it really really work well. And this with Raptor 3 with and Starship and booster version three uh we it should be able to achieve all of the things that I just mentioned which is a rapidly reusable reliable rocket uh with orbital refilling. Basically all of the ingredients necessary uh to make life mult multilanetary will be achieved with version three of Starship which we're aiming to launch for the first time at the end of this year. [Applause] Yeah. So you can see this is uh kind of where things are on the left where things will be uh end of this year in the middle and as I was saying kind of where things will be probably longterm um yeah 142 m. So, but the the one in the middle is is full will be fully capable of of doing Mars. Uh, and uh thereafter we'll it'll be a lot of uh performance improvements. Um, and as as has been the case with Falcon 9, we always end up making the rocket longer um and increasing payload. So, that's uh that's that's the game plan. Pretty straightforward. Um, but it's important to emphasize even with the rocket that will be launching just at the end of this year, it will be capable of making life multilanetary and thereafter it's it's it's just about continuing to hone the efficiency and capability of the rocket and and reduce the cost per ton and reduce the cost per person to Mars and and like I said, ultimately make it so that anyone who wants to move to Mars and help build a new civilization can do so. So, anyone out there, like how cool would that would that be? And even if you don't want to do it, maybe that you have a son or daughter who wants to do that or a friend who wants to do it. And I think it would be the adventure, the best adventure that it one could possibly do is to go and help build a new civilization on a new planet. [Applause] So yeah, ultimately we'll we'll have 42 engines which it was inevitable um as as the prophecy foretold uh by the great prophet Douglas Adams in his uh you know book of the Hitchhog's Guide to the Galaxy. Uh the answer to the meaning of life is 42. Um and so inevitably the Starship stack will have 42 [Applause] engines. And in terms of payload to orbit, what's remarkable is that it's 200 tons of you know Starship will have 200 tons payload to orbit with full reusability. So this is twice the capability of the Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Saturn 5 moon rocket was fully expendable. Uh Starship is fully reusable but will have twice the payload to orbit um of the the next biggest rocket that made it to orbit which is a Saturn 5. Um in fact if without reusability Starship would have about 400 tons of payload to orbit. So this is a this is a very big rocket is what I'm saying. So but you need a big rocket you know to you know make life multilanetary. Um and then along the way we could do very cool things like have a moon base um like moon base alpha long ago there was a TV show about moon base alpha. Um you can't couldn't think about the physics of that too much because apparently like the moon base was like drifting away from earth. Um but uh anyway we should have a moon base alpha which is the next step after the Apollo program would be to have a base on the moon. Um so you could like you could have a like a gigantic um you know science station uh doing research about the nature of the universe on the moon would be very cool. So in terms of like when can you go to Mars? So you can go to Mars every two years or every 26 months. Um so the next Mars opportunity is at the end of next year in about 18 months. So November, December is the next Mars opportunity. So we'll try to make that opportunity if we get lucky. I think we'll probably have a 50/50 chance right now because we've got to uh we've got to figure out orbital refilling uh in order to um have enough capability to go to Mars. But if we achieve orbital refilling in time, then we will launch the first uh uncrrewed uh Starship to Mars at the end of next year. [Applause] So So this gives you an illustration of of how does how does a spaceship go from Earth to Mars. So you got blue Earth there and red Mars. And I mean the the the actual distance traveled on the ark is close to like a thousand times further than the moon. So you can't just go straight to Mars. You have to create this elliptical orbit with Earth at one point and Mars at the other side at the far end of the ellipse. and then time the time the the where you are in that or in that ellipse to intersect with Mars. And this so this is the the orbital transfer how how you do orbital transfer from Earth to Mars. And if you look on your Starlink Wi-Fi router, you'll see this image because the Starlink Wi-Fi is uh what is or Starink internet is what's being used to pay for um humanity getting to Mars. So, I just like to thank everyone out there who has bought Starlink because you're helping pay helping secure the future of civilization and helping uh make life multip multilanetary and helping make humanity a space bearing civilization. Thank you. So this is a tentative game plan here where we're hoping to that we're hoping to achieve um where we increase the the cadence of flights to Mars dramatically with every launch window. So every every roughly two years um we are dramatically increasing the number of of of ships that go to Mars um and ultimately try to get to a,000 or 2,000 ships u you know per Mars uh rendevous. Um, so the the I mean as a rough order of magnitude, this just guesses obviously, but we we need to get about a thou about about a million tons is my guess um to the surface of Mars to make um uh a civilization on Mars self-sustaining and getting to that critical point where um if the if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, Mars still succeeds. Mars can still grow. And so you can't be missing anything. You can't be missing even like the equivalent of vitamin C or anything. You've got to have everything you need for Mars to grow. Um that's that's essential. So my guess is that's about a million tons, but it might be 10 million tons. Uh I hope it's not 100 million tons. That'd be a lot. Um but uh we want to try to get to that point and secure the future of civilization as quickly as possible. So we're looking at different locations. Um the lead candidate right now is the Arcadia region. So um now Mars has a lot of real estate, but when you combine all of the factors and say, okay, we need we can't be too close to the poles, we need to be um near ice for for to get to get water. Um and uh can't be too mountainous for the rockets. Um then you you it narrows down to a smaller region. So, Arcadia is uh uh it's one of my my my daughter's name is Arcadia actually. Um and is one of the the options. So, we got the first starships on Mars, gather critical data. So, the first the first flights there we'll we'll send with the Optimus robot um so we can go out there and explore and kind of prepare the way for humans and um that'll be a very cool image if we're able to achieve it um by launching end of next year. would actually technically arrive in 2027. Uh but that would be uh an epic fixture to see Optimus walking around on the surface of Mars. And then with the launching two years later, uh we would be sending humans assuming the first missions are successful and they land successfully, we'd send humans on on the next mission. uh and we really start building the infrastructure for Mars. So anyway, might maybe just to be safe and we might just do two two landing episodes with the Optimus and do the third one with humans. We'll see. So that that classic picture of the workers on the Empire State and then for communications on Mars uh we'll be using a version of Starlink to provide uh internet on Mars. Yeah. So the the the speed of light even at moving at the speed of light your best case scenario is I guess I think around 3 and a half minutes to Mars uh and then worst case is uh 22 minutes or more because Mars is on the other side of the sun from Earth. So anyway it's it's quite challenging to do high bandwidth communications with Mars but Starlink will achieve that. Um, yeah, and then we'll have the first humans lay the groundwork for permanent uh presence on the surface. Um, and yeah, the goal, like I said, will be to make Mars self- sustaining as quickly as possible. This is just a sort of rough idea of what things will be like for the first city on Mars. My guess is we'll probably put the launch pads a little further away. um or the landing pads just in case. But uh I mean for Mars we're going to need uh a lot of solar power. Um we'll be you know since you you can't really walk around on the surface of Mars at least as yet until Mars is terraformed to be like Earth. Um the you you need to walk around with a Mars suit um and be you know initially in kind of glass domes. Um, but it would work. Um, and eventually we can make Mars into an Earthlike planet. And we want to get to the point where we're uh transferring over a million tons uh at every Mars transfer window. And then we that's like a serious civilization. A megaton per transfer window. So yeah, it would have a lot of spaceports. I mean, because of the fact that you can't fly there continuously and you have to transfer in these windows, you'd have a gathering of a thousand ships or 2,000 ships or more than that. So we look have this kind of like battle star galactica field where all these ships are in orbit waiting to depart and uh and then they they'd all depart. Um I look at I think an amazing image of all these ships departing at once and then you're going to need obviously uh a lot of launch pads a lot of landing pads on Mars. Um or you'll need to move the the ships off the landing pad pretty fast. Um, so if you get a you got uh I don't know a few thousand ships inbound, probably need at least a few hundred pads, landing pads and um anyway, we'll solve that problem later. So yeah, anyway, this is this is like an incredible thing to have like this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet, and um a new world. Um, and it's also an opportunity to, I think, for the Martians to to rethink how they want civilization to be. So, you can maybe rethink like what kind of form of government do you want? What new rules do you want to have? Um, there's a lot of freedom and opportunity in Mars to do a recompile on civilization, which will be up to the Martians. So, all right, let's get it done. Thank you everyone. [Applause]",

Well, I mean, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but >> um >> but uh No, I think I think he actually just kind of looked like that in reality. >> Wow. >> Um so >> like like he's a pretty unique looking individual. >> I think we can achieve this. That guy right there, that's a real guy. >> That's a real dude. >> I always thought that was CGI. >> No, I think one of I think the upper right one is not him. That's not >> But that one to the left of that like that's real. No, that's that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it? >> It's It's not impossible. >> No, no, it's not impossible to achieve, but it's not it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness. I mean, that's like like you're you're also at that point they're he's dehydrating and all sorts of things. >> Oh, it's based on a real person. >> Yeah. Yeah. Based on, >> right, but it's not a real person. What does he really look like? >> Like those images, I think, are [ __ ] >> Some of them are. Is that real? Okay. That That looks real. That looks like a really jack bodybuilder. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, that looks real. Like that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, \"What's going on here?\" >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um >> Well, I mean, you see you see >> that guy is that is that the >> that's the real dude? >> Well, there's that that that Icelandic dude who's Thor. >> Oh, yeah. The guy who jumps in the frozen lakes and [ __ ] >> Well, the guy who played the mountain. Um >> Oh, that guy. >> That is that is like a that that is like a a mutant strong human. Yes. >> Like like uh he would be in like the X-Men or something, you know? >> He's just like not like uh >> and there's that you know that have you seen that meme tent and tent bag? >> Um you know how like it's like it's really hard to get the tent tent in >> Oh, right. Right. >> That's true. >> Then there's a picture of of him and his girlfriend. That's hilarious. >> Yeah, that's >> I don't know how it gets in there, you know? It's like it seems too small. But >> I met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw is like the world's most powerful man. And he's almost 7 feet tall. He's 400 lb. >> And his his bone density is 1 in 500 million people. So there's one it's like there's like maybe 16 people. >> He's an enormous human being. like a legitimate giant just like that guy. But we met him. He was hanging out with us in the green room of the mother ship. It's like, okay, if this was like David and Goliath days, like this is an actual giant like the giants of the Bible. >> Once in a while they get a super giant person. >> This is a real a real one. Like not a tall skinny basketball player, like a 7 foot 400B powerliffter. >> Like you don't want to especially look at him. That's the guy. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. I >> was trying to get >> There it is. That's him right there. Like there's like there's like one of him with next to standing next to Arnold and stuff and it's where and everyone everyone just looks tiny. >> I mean I think he's a pretty cool dude actually. >> Oh, Brian's very cool. Very smart, too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big. It's got to be a [ __ ] >> No. >> Yeah. There was there's Andre the Giant who was awesome. You >> he was great in Princess Bride and >> No, he was just awesome period. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, we were talking about um this interview with Sam Alman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life. >> Yeah. >> Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was a whistleblower, whatever. >> A whistleblower who, you know, >> committed suicide, but it doesn't look like it. >> And and he's talking to Sam Alman about this. And Sam Alton was like, \"Are you accusing me?\" He's like, \"No, no, no. I'm not. I'm just saying I I think someone killed him. >> Yeah. And like And it should be investigated. >> Yeah. >> Um not just drop the case. >> It seems like >> they just dropped the case. Yeah. Yeah. But his parents think he was murdered. >> Yeah. >> Um the wires to a security camera were cut. Um >> blood in two rooms. >> Blood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. And >> someone else's wig. >> Wig. >> Wig. Yes. Not his wig. >> Not normal to have a wig laying around. >> Yes. Um and um and he ordered Door Dash uh right before allegedly committing suicide. >> Uh which uh is it seems unusual, you know? >> Yeah. >> It's like, you know, let's I'm going to order pizza on second thoughts, I'll kill myself. Uh is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset. >> It's very weird. And especially the parents have they they don't believe he committed suicide at all. >> Has no note or anything. >> No. >> Yeah. >> It seems pretty [ __ ] up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked, that's not outside the pale. >> I mean, it's straight out of a movie. >> Right out of a movie, but right out of a movie is real sometimes. >> Yeah. Right. Exactly. >> It's a little weird that I I think they should do a proper investigation. Like, what's the downside on that proper investigation? >> Right. >> No. >> Yeah, >> for sure. But the whole exchange is so bizarre. >> Yeah. Yeah. Sam Alman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre. >> Look, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty. >> So, I'm like, >> or look more weird. >> Yeah. >> You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like, maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked and then I'd be like, \"Wait, what are you what are you are you accusing me of killing my friend?\" Like, \"What the [ __ ] are you talking about?\" I would I would be a little bit more I rate. >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know, it would be >> I would be a little upset. >> Yeah. It'd be like Well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. >> As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug. >> Yeah. I wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious. If Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, \"That does seem like a murder. [ __ ] We should look into this.\" >> I mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not not saying, you know, Tim Molvin had anything to do with the murder, but uh >> blood in two rooms. >> It's blood in two rooms. Like, yeah, there's the wires to the security camera and the door dash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note. his parents think uh he was murdered and um the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like this why would you jump to the conclusion >> parents sued the >> uh landlord? >> They sued the son's landlord alleged the owners and the managers of their son's San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread cover up of his death. >> The landlord >> Yeah. There's a bunch of weird They said there was like packages missing from the building. Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and all a sudden they all disappeared. >> Huh. But that could be people steal people's packages all the time. >> The porch pirate situation. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Says they failed to safeguard. >> Also, I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that. I mean, it must >> God bless them. And how could they stay sane after something like that? They're probably they're so griefstricken. Who knows what they believe at this point. >> Yeah. It should have asked if Epson killed himself. Yeah, that's the the Cash Mattel thing. Cash Mattel Dan Bonino trying to convince everybody of that. Like, okay. >> The guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and um >> you know, >> the guards were asleep. The cameras weren't working. He had a a giant steroided up bodybuilder guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer who was a bad cop. Like, all of it's kind of nuts. All of it's kind of nuts like that he would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends. >> Yeah. >> And then >> did you see Tim Dylan talking to Chris Cuomo about this? >> I did. He liked the idea. >> Chris Cromo just looked so stupid. >> Tim just listed off all the >> Tim just and he's like I agree it is strange. Like of course it's strange Chris. Jesus Christ. You can't just go with the tide. You got to think things through. And if you think that one through, you're like, I don't think he killed himself. Nobody does. You'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself. >> It does. It does seem unlikely. >> It seems highly unlikely. Highly, highly unlikely. All roads point to murder. >> Yes. >> Point to they had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever the [ __ ] he was doing, whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever thing he was up to, you know, was apparently very effective. >> Yes. And a lot of people are compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. Like, relax everybody. I know I scared the [ __ ] out of you for the last decade and a half, but ah, we're going to be fine. >> Yeah. I mean, you know, as was I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. It's It feels like reality is accelerating. >> It's every day. And Every day it's like more and more ridiculous to the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable. >> Yeah. Yeah. It really feels like simulation, you know? It's like, come on. What are the odds that this could be the case? >> Are you paying attention at all to Three Atlas? Are you watching the >> the comet? >> Yeah. Whatever it is. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I if if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, um, you Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. >> Okay. >> Yeah, >> that's a good deal. >> Yeah, it's pretty good. >> I'll believe you. Yeah, thank you. >> I I'll stick I keep my you know, keep my promises. So, um >> All right. I'll hold you to that. >> Yeah. Yeah. And and I'm never committing suicide to be clear. >> I don't think you would either. >> So, on camera, guys, I am never committing suicide ever. >> If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. >> I will fight tooth and nail. I will I will not believe it. I will not believe it. The thing about the three eye atlas is it's >> a hell of a name actually. >> Yeah, it's a third eye sounds like third eye or something. >> Yeah, it does. Three eye is third. It's only the third interstellar object that's detected. >> Okay. >> Yeah. Obias. >> Yeah. Alo was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it. >> Yeah. It could be. I don't know. But I >> apparently today they're saying that it's changed course. Um, >> did you see that, Jamie? >> Avi said something today. I'll send it to you. Um, >> uh, I know it's on Reddit. >> Here you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. Um, it's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. And the only way that exists, uh, here is, uh, industrial alloys apparently. Um um most no there are there are >> there are definitely uh comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel in fact. Yeah. So the the places where um you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was a nickel rich uh you know >> nickel rich nickel rich rich deposit. >> Yeah that's that's that's it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't want to be there at the time because anything would have been obliterated. Right. Um, but that's that's where the the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days. >> So, this is Ovio Lope. A few hours ago, the first hint of non-gravitational acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration, meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated. Interesting. Um so it's mostly nickel very little iron which uh he was saying uh is on earth only exists in alloys but whatever you know you're dealing with another planet >> there this there are there are there are cases where there's very nickel richch asteroids meteorites that heavy that something from space. >> Yeah it it's only yeah it doesn't mean it'll be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah. >> And [ __ ] huge. The size of Manhattan and all nickel. That's kind of nuts. >> Yeah, that's a heavy spaceship. >> That's a real problem if it hits. >> Uh yes. No, it would like obliterate a continent type of thing. >> Um maybe maybe worse. >> Probably kill most of human life. >> Um >> if not all of us. >> I haven't depends on what the the total mass is. But um there's I mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are um you know there's like arguably arguably five major extinction events. um like the biggest one of which is the Perine extinction uh where um almost all life was eliminated. That that actually occurred over several million several million years. Um the there's the Jurassic. I think Jurassic is I think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid. Um and um but there's but there's been five major extinction events, but um but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out a continent. >> So >> merely >> Yeah. cuz that that because those don't really show up on the fossil record, you know, >> right? >> Um so unless it's enough to cause a you know mass extinction event throughout Earth, it it doesn't show up, you know, in a fossil record that's uh 200 million years old. Um so the uh yeah but but there have been many um many impacts that would have sort of destroyed all life on you know let's say half of North America or something like that. there many such impacts through the course of history. >> Yeah. And there's nothing we can do about it right now. >> Yeah. There was one that um hits there was a one that hit Siberia and destroyed I think um few hundred square miles. >> Oh, that's the Tungusa. >> Yeah. That's the one from the 1920s, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor that uh comet storm that we go through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that younger dest. >> Yeah. Yeah, all that shit's crazy. Um, thank you before we go any further for letting us have a tour of SpaceX and letting us be there for the rocket launch. >> One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. And we we've we were we thought it was only like I thought it was a half a mile. Jamie's like it was a mile away. Turned out it's almost two miles away. And you feel it in your chest. >> Yeah. It's >> you have to wear earplugs and you feel it in your chest and it's 2 miles away. >> It was [ __ ] amazing. And then to go with you up into the command center and to watch all the Starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real time as it made its way all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35 40 minutes. >> Yeah. >> Wild it touchdown in Australia. >> Yeah. >> [ __ ] crazy. It was amazing. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Absolutely amazing. The starship's awesome. Um, and anyone can go watch the launch actually. So, you can just go to um, South Padre Island, get has a great view of the launch. Um, so it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. >> Um, but um, but we'll be flying pretty frequently um, out of Starbase in South Texas. And we we formally incorporated it as a city. So, it's it's actually a legally an actual legal city, Starbase, Texas. >> Um, it's not that often you hear like, hey, we made a city, you know. Um, that used to be like the like in in the old days like a startup would be you go and gather a bunch of people and say, \"Hey, let's go make a town.\" Literally, that was like that would have been startups in in in the old days. >> Um, >> or a country. >> Yeah. Or a country. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, >> if you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem. >> Yeah. That things are so much so much set in stone on the country front these days. You might pull it off. You might be able to pull it off. If you got a a solid island, you might be able to pull it off. >> You know, it's probably, >> you know, like like at owns lai. >> Yeah, you could probably if you put if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country. >> This is one of the different ones. This is one of the ones that you catch, >> right? Or is that one? >> Yeah, that that's the booster. So that's the super heavy booster. Uh so that's the one with the booster's got 33 engines. Um that that uh um and it's you know by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. Um you know right now it's about 7 8,000 tons of thrust. Um, that's that's the largest flying object ever made. >> I had to explain to someone. They were going, \"Why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart?\" Because there was there was this [ __ ] idiot on television. Some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you. And he goes, \"Oh, I think he's a fuckwit.\" And he goes, \"He's a fuckwit.\" And he goes, \"Why you say he's [ __ ] Oh, his rockets keep blowing up.\" And someone said, \"Yeah, well, why do his rockets blow?\" And I had to explain. Yeah. Because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are. You have to you have to a few >> corners of the box. So, so like so when you do a new uh rocket development program, um you you have to uh do what's called uh you know, exploring the limits, the corners of the box where you say it's like you worst case this, worst case that um to figure out um uh where where the limits are. So uh you blow up, you know, not not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally. Um but but we intentionally subject it to uh uh you know a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flight so that when we put people on board or valuable cargo it doesn't blow up. Um so um so so for example for the the flight that you saw we we actually deliberately took um heat shield tiles off the the the ship the off of Starship in in some of the worst locations to say okay if we lose a heat shield tile here is it is it catastrophic or is it not? Um and we we nonetheless uh Starship was able to do a soft landing um in uh in the Indian Ocean just uh west of Australia. Um which as and it got there from Texas in like I don't know 354 minutes type of thing. So >> So it landed even though you put it through this situation where it has compromised shield. it it had an an an an unusually we we we brought it in hot like an an extra hot trajectory uh with missing tiles um to see if it would still make it to a soft landing which it did. Now I I should point out it did have there were some holes that were burnt into it. Um but it's it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt you know that that you know cuz it's coming it's coming in like a blazing meteor. You can see you can see the real time video. Well, tell me the speed again because the the speed was bananas. You were talking about >> Yeah, it's like 17,000 mph like like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So, um the uh uh so so think of it like it's it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle. You know, bullet from assault rifles around Mach 2 >> and it's just and it's huge. >> Yeah. Yeah. Or or if you compare it to like a bullet from a um you know a 45 or or 9 mil which is subsonic that's you know it it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. >> 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun and it's the size of a skyscraper. >> Yes. >> Yeah. That's fast. >> It's so wild. It's so wild to see, man. It It's uh It's so exciting. This the factor is so exciting too because like genuinely no [ __ ] I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie where someone had expectations and they like what are they doing? They're building rockets. And you go there and as we were walking through Jamie, you could speak to this too. Didn't you have the feeling where you're like >> oh this is way bigger than I thought it was. This is huge. Awesome. >> Gigantic. >> [ __ ] crazy. >> That's what she said. the ah the amount of rockets you're making. I don't know if you >> tent back. >> Gig Chad in the house. >> This is way big. >> It's a giant metal dick. You're [ __ ] [ __ ] the universe with your giant metal dick. That's >> I mean, yeah, it is. It is very big. >> And the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version and you have a new updated version that's coming soon. >> And what is the It's a It's a little longer. Um >> more pointy. >> Uh it's the same amount of pointy. Um but the there's it's it's got a bit more length. Um the the interstage, you see that that interstage section with kind of like the grill area. >> Mhm. >> Um that's uh that's now integrated with the boost stage. Um so uh we do um what's called hot staging. Uh where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. So the boost the booster engines are still thrusting. is still it's it's uh you know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship. Uh but then we light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster even though the booster engines are still firing. >> Whoa. >> Um so it's blasting flame through uh that that grill section but we integrate that grill section into uh the boost stage with the next uh version of the rocket. Um and uh and explosion in the rocket will have the Raptor 3 engines which are a huge improvement. Um you may you may have seen them in the lobby because we got like the Raptor 1, two, and three. And you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity. Um we should probably put a plaque there to also show how much the we reduced the weight uh the cost and the and improved the efficiency and the uh thrust. So the Raptor 3 uh has uh you know almost twice the thrust of Raptor Raptor 1. >> Wow. >> So you see Raptor 3. It looks like it looks like it's got parts missing. Right. >> And how many >> It's very very clean. >> How many of them are on the rocket? >> There's 33 on the on the booster. >> Whoa. Um and and each of each Raptor engine is producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 747. Wow. So that engine is smaller than a 747 engine, but is producing, you know, um you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 747 engine. Um so extremely high power to weight ratio. Um and um >> and so when there's >> 33 of them >> you when you so when you're designing these you get to Raptor one you see its efficiency you see where you can improve it you get to Raptor 2 how many how far can you scale this up with just the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines like how much further can you >> I mean we're pushing the limits of physics here um so um and and really in order to to make a a fully reusable orbital rocket which no one has succeeded in doing uh yet including including us. Um but but uh Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where where full and rapid reusability is actually possible. So it was not there's not there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that that got made any hardware at all. Um just we just we just live we live on a planet uh where the gravity uh is is is quite high like earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high. Um um and if the gravity was even 10 or 20% uh higher uh we'd be stuck on Earth forever. Um like we yeah we could not use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. Um so but on the other hand if if Earth's gravity was just a little lower like even 10 20% lower it then uh getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like it's like it's like this if this was a video game it's set to like maximum difficulty but not impossible. >> Okay. >> Um so that's that's where we have um here. So it's it's not as though um others have uh ignored the concept of reusability. they've just uh concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at on on this for a long time at at SpaceX. Um and um you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Um although I should say that that uh you know, we have an extremely talented engineering team. I think we've got the best uh rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled. Um uh it's it's an honor to work with such such incredible people. Um so uh so so it's fair to say that you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability but we at last have a rocket uh where full reusability is possible. Um and I think I think we'll achieve it next year. So um uh that's a that's a really big deal. And the reason the reason that's that's such a big deal is that full reusability um uh drops the cost of access to space by a hundred um maybe even more than 100 actually. So could be like a thousand. The you can think of it like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane like like imagine if like the way the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and and and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out um and the plane crashes somewhere and you land at your desk and you and you land on a parachute at your destination. Now that would be a very expensive trip and you and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. Um, but that's how the other rockets in the world work. Um, now the SpaceX Falcon rocket is the only one that is is there that is at least mostly reusable. You've se you've seen the Falcon rocket, you know, land. We've now done over 500 landings of of the SpaceX rocket of the of the Falcon 9 rocket. Um and um and and this year um you know we we'll deliver probably I don't know somewhere between 2200 and 2500 tons to orbit um with with the Falcon 9 uh Falcon Heavy rockets uh not counting anything for from Starship. Um >> and this is mostly Starlink. Yes, mostly Starling, but we launch uh many other we even launch our competitors on um competitors to Starink on on Falcon 9. We charge them the same price. Pretty fair. Um uh but uh SpaceX this year will deliver um roughly 90% of all Earth mass to orbit. >> Wow. >> Um and then of the remaining 10% um most of that is done by China. And then the then the remaining kind of roughly 4% is uh everyone else in the world including our America uh domestic competitors. >> You know um it's kind of incredible how many things are in space like how many things are floating above us now? >> There's a lot of things. >> Yeah. >> Is there though? >> Right. But is there a saturation point where we're going to have problems with all these different satellites that are >> um I think as long as the satellites are um maintained uh there's there it'll be fine. This space is very roomy. Um it's like you can think of um like space as being concentric shells of the surface of the earth. So, um, you know, there's there's it's the surface of the earth, but but there's it's a series >> much larger. >> Yeah. It's like a series of concentric trails. Um, >> and think of an Airstream trailer flying around up there. There's a lot of room for air streams. >> Yeah. I mean, imagine Yeah. If there just a few thousand airirstreams um on on Earth. >> Yeah. >> What are the odds that they'd hit each other? You know, >> they wouldn't be very crowded. No. And then you got to go bigger. >> Yeah. >> Because you're dealing with far above Earth. >> Hundreds of miles above Earth. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, it's the um but the goal of SpaceX is to get rocket technology to the point where we can extend life beyond Earth and that we can establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Uh a permanent base on the moon. That would be very cool. I mean, imagine if we had like a, you know, moon base alpha where there's like a permanent science base on the moon. >> That would be pretty dope. Or at least a tourist trap. >> I mean, a lot of people be willing to go to the moon for just for a tour. That's for sure. We could probably pay for our space program with that, you know, >> probably. Yeah. Well, >> because it's like if if you if you could go to the moon with and and safely, >> uh I think we'd get a lot of people uh would would pay for that, you know. >> Oh, 100%. After the first year, after nobody died for like >> Yeah. Just make sure. Exactly. Are you going to come back? Yeah. >> Because like that submarine, they they had a bunch of successful launches in that private submarine before it imploded and killed everybody. That was not a good design. Obviously, >> it was a very bad design. Terrible design. >> And the engineers said it would not withstand the pressure of those depths. Like there was a lot of whistleblowers in that company too. >> Yeah. Um they they they made that out of uh carbon fiber which is it doesn't make any sense because um you actually need you need to be dense to go down. Um in any case, just make it out of steel. If you make it out of uh sort of just, you know, a big steel casting, that's that's you you'll be safe and nothing. Why would they make it out of carbon fiber then? Is it cheaper? >> Um I think they think carbon fiber sounds cool or something. But uh >> it does sound cool. >> It it sounds cool, but um because it's such it's such low density, you actually actually have to add extra mass to go down because it's it's low density. But if you just have a giant, you know, hollow ball bearing, uh you're going to be fine. >> Speaking of carbon fiber, did you check out my unplugged Tesla out there? >> Yeah, it's cool. >> Pretty sick, right? Yeah. Have you guys ever thought about doing something like that? like having like an AMG division of Tesla where you do like custom stuff. >> Um I think it's best to leave that to the custom shops. Uh you know we're we're like Tesla's focus is autonomous cars. Um you know building kind of futuristic autonomous cars. Um so um like I think it's we want the future to look like the future. Um, so the did like did you see like our designs for like the sort of the robotic bus? It looks pretty cool. >> The robotic bus is also being totally auton but it looks it looks cool. It's it's very art deco. It's it's like it's like futuristic art deco. Um, and um, it it does it like I think we want to change the aesthetic over time. You don't want the aesthetic to be constant over time. You want to evolve the aesthetic. Um, so um, you know, like my like I have a son who's he's like, you know, he's he's he's like even more autistic than me and um and, uh, but he's he has these great observations. Who is this? >> A Saxon. He has these great observations in the world uh because he's he just views the world through a different lens than than most people. Um and he was like, \"Dad, why does the world look like it's 2015?\" >> And I'm like, \"Damn, the world does look like it's 2015.\" Like the aesthetic has not evolved since 2015. >> Oh, that's what it looks like. >> Yeah. >> Oh, wow. >> That's pretty cool. >> Oh, yeah. That's like >> like You'd want to see that going down the road, you know? >> Yeah. You'd be like, \"Okay, this is we're in the future.\" You know, it doesn't look like 2015. >> What is that ancient science fiction movie? Like one of the first science fiction movies ever. Is it Metropolis? Is that what it is? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. That looks like it belongs in Metropolis. >> Yeah. Yeah. It's a futuristic art deco. >> All right. Yeah. Well, that's cool that you're concentrating on the aesthetic. I mean, that's kind of the whole deal with Cybertruck, right? Like, it didn't have to look like that. >> No, it it I just wanted to have something that looked really different. Is it a pain in the ass for people to get it insured because it's all solid steel and >> um I hope it's not too much. I you know Tesla does offer insurance so people can always get it get it insured at Tesla. >> Um well but the like it is the form does follow a function in the case of the cybert truck because um as you demonstrated with with your armorpiercing arrow um because if you shot that arrow at a regular truck I mean >> it exactly you would have found your arrow in the wall. Yeah. Um, you know, it would very least it would have buried into one of the seats. >> Yeah. Yeah. It's but like you could you could definitely make uh get enough of bow velocity and and the right the right arrow would go through both doors of a regular truck and and and land on the wall. >> If there was a clear shot between both doors, it probably would have passed right through. >> Exactly. Um but but you know the the arrow shattered on the cybert truck cuz it's it's ultra hard uh stainless. Mhm. >> Um, so, um, and I thought it' be I thought it'd be cool to have a, you know, a truck that is bulletproof to a subsonic projectile. Um, so, um, you know, especially in this day and age, you know, like as as a if, if the apocalypse happens, you're going to want to have a bulletproof truck, you know. Um, so so then because because it's made of ultra hot stainless, it's you can't just stamp the the panels. You can't just put in a stamping press because it breaks the press. So, so in order to actually, so it has to has to be planer um because it's so difficult to bend it because it breaks the machine that bends it. Um that's why that's why it's it's it's it's so planer and and it's not uh you know it's it's because it's bulletproof steel is the >> So it is like boxy as opposed to like curved and >> Yeah. You just in order to make in order to make like the curved shapes, you you you take you take uh uh basically mild steel like um anneal thin and thin anneal in a regular truck or car. The you take you take mild thin anneal steel, you put it in a stamping press and it just sm it just smooshes it and makes it to whatever the shape whatever shape you want. But the Cybert truck is made made of ultra hard stainless. Um and and and so you can't stamp it because it would break the stamping press. So it even bending it is hard. So even to bend it to uh its current position, we have to way overbend it. Um and and so it gets so that when it springs back, it's in in the right position. Um, so it's uh I don't know like I I think if you want to like I think it's it's it's a unique aesthetic. Um, and you say, \"Well, what's cool about a truck?\" Trucks are trucks are like should be I don't know manly. They should be macho, you know, and bulletproof is maximum macho macho. >> Are you married to that shape now? Like is it can you do anything to change it? Like as you get further like I know you guys updated the three and the Y. Did you update the Y as well? >> Yes, the the three and the Y uh are updated. Um you know, there's like a um there's there's a a screen in the back for the kid that the kids can watch, for example, in the new 3 and Y. Um uh so in the new Y, um there's, you know, it's it's an there's there's there's like hundreds of improvements. Like we keep improving the car. Um and even the Cybert truck, we you know, we keep improving it. Um but um you know I wanted to just do something that that looked unique and and the cybert truck looks unique and has unique functionality and there was and it was like there were three things as I report like let's make it bulletproof. Uh let's uh make it faster than a Porsche 911. Uh, and we actually cleared the quarter mile. The Cybert truck, the the uh can uh clear a quarter mile while towing a Porsche 911 faster than a Porsche 911. Um, it can out tow an F350 diesel. >> Really? >> Yes. >> What is the tow limitations? >> I mean, we could tow like a, you know, a 747 in that with a cy. Cybert truck is an insanely like it is an it is alien technology. Okay. Um cuz it it shouldn't be possible to be uh that big and that fast. Uh that doesn't it's like an elephant that runs as as like a cheetah. >> Yeah. Because it's 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds, right? >> Yes. >> Yeah. And it's enormous. What does it weigh? Like 7,000 lbs. >> Uh yeah, there's different configurations, but it's about that. Uh it's a beast. >> Yeah. >> Um so and it's and it's got it's got four-wheel steering. So the the rear wheel steer, too. So it's got a it's got a very tight turning radius. >> Yeah. We noticed that we when we drove one to Star Base. >> Yeah. Very tight turning radius. >> Yeah. Pretty sick. >> Yeah. >> Are you still doing the Roadster? >> Yes. Eventually, >> we're getting close to demonstrating the prototype >> and I think this will be I I I I one thing I can guarantee is that this product demo will be unforgettable. Unforgettable. >> How so? Whether it's good or bad, it will be unforgettable. Um, >> can you say more? What do you mean? >> Well, you know, my friend Peter Teal, um, you know, uh, once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars. >> So, you're going to be able to fly? Well, I mean, uh, I think if Peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one. >> So, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car? Is this like a real thing? >> Well, we have to see in the >> in the demo. So, when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing? Like, what is the idea behind this? Don't be sly. Come on. >> I I I can't I can't uh do the unveil before the unveil. Um but um >> tell me off air then. >> I I I it look I I think it has a shot at being the most memorable um product unveil ever. It has a shot. >> And when do you plan on doing this? What's the goal? >> Uh hopefully before the end of the year. >> Really? >> Before the end of this year. >> This is I mean we're in a couple months. >> Hopefully in a couple months. Um you know we need to make sure that it works. Uh like this is some crazy crazy technology we got in this car. Crazy technology. Crazy crazy. So different than what was previously announced and >> Yes. >> And is that why you haven't released it yet? Cuz you keep [ __ ] with it. >> It has crazy technology. >> Okay. >> Like is it even a car? I'm not sure. It's like it looks like a car. Let's just put this way. It it's it's crazier than anything James Bond. If you took all the James Bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that. >> Very exciting. >> I don't know what to think of that. >> I don't know. >> It's a limited amount of information I'm drawing from here. >> Jamie's very suspicious over there. Look at him. >> Excited. >> I'm interested. >> It's still going to be the same. >> Well, you know what? I mean, if if you want to if you want to come a little before the uh the unveil, I can show it to you 100%. Yeah, let's go. >> Yeah. Um it's uh it's kind of crazy all the different things that you're involved in simultaneously and you know we talked about this before your time management but I I really don't understand it. I don't understand how you can be paying attention to all these different things simultaneously. Starlink, SpaceX, Tesla, boring company X you're tweet you [ __ ] tweet or post rather all day long. Well, it's more like I'm I'm I could hop in for like two minutes and then hop out, you know. >> But I mean, just the fact that you could do >> bathroom break or whatever, you know, >> I can't do that. >> Um >> if I hop in, I start scrolling and I start looking around. Next thing you know, I've lost an hour. >> Yeah. >> Um so, no, it's for me it's it's a couple minutes time usually. It's once in a Sometimes I guess it's half an hour, but usually I'm I'm I'm in for a few minutes then out of of you know, posting something on X. Uh, you know, it's I do sometimes feel like it's sometimes like that that meme of the guy who's like who drops the grenade and leaves the room. That's been me more than once on on X. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Um, it's got to be fun, though. It's got to be fun to know that you essentially disrupted the entire social media chain of command because there was a there was a very clear thing that was going on with social media. The government had infiltrated it. They were censoring speech >> and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it. We kind of assumed that there was something going on. >> Yeah. We had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring actual real news stories, real data, real scientists, real professors silenced, expelled, kicked off the platform. >> Yeah. >> Wild. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> For telling the truth. >> For telling the truth. And I'm sure you've also because I sent it to you that chart that shows uh young kids, teenagers identifying as trans and non-binary literally stops dead when you bought Twitter and starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational discussions now and actually talk about it. >> Yes. >> Yeah. >> Um Yeah. Yeah, I mean I I said at the time like I think that like the the like the reason for acquiring Twitter is because um it was it it was c it was causing destruction at a civilizational level. Um it was um I mean I posted I tweeted on on Twitter at the time that um it it is um you know it's it's uh worm tongue for the world. um you know like Worm Tongue from Lord of the Rings uh where he would just sort of like whisper these you know terrible things to the king so the king would believe these things that weren't true um and and um unfortunately uh Twitter really got it got like the the the woke mob essentially they controlled Twitter um and they were pushing uh a nihilistic anti-vilizational mind virus to the world. Um, and you can see the results of that mind virus on the streets of San Francisco, uh, where, you know, downtown San Francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse. Um, you know, it's it's bad. Um, so we don't want the whole world to be a zombie apocalypse. Um, but that's uh that that that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic, untrue worldview on the world and it was causing a lot of damage. Um, so >> the stunning thing about it is how few people course corrected. A bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on. People that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015 or 16 and then and then eventually it comes to affect them or they see it in their workplace or they see and they're like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this.\" Bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected. >> Yeah. Um, a lot of a lot of people didn't course correct, but um, but it's gone directionally in it's gone it's it's directionally correct like you mentioned like the like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans and then that that spike dropping um after the the Twitter acquisition. I think that um simply allowing the truth to be told um was that just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say and just allowing sunlight um kills the virus >> and it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms. Yes, you can't just openly censor people and all the other platforms and X is available. So everybody else had a So like Facebook announced they were changing YouTube announced they were changing their policies and they're kind of forced to And then blue sky doubled down. >> Well, like the problem is like if >> uh essentially the woke mind virus retreated to woke to to blue sky. >> Yeah. >> Um but it's where they're just a self-reinforcing lunatic assign. >> They're all just triple masked. I I was I was totally watching this exchange on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something and then someone a moderator immediately chimed in and why don't you try to stop being racist against Asians by saying something zen by saying I'm trying to be zen about something. They were accusing that person of being racist towards Asians. >> Yeah. It's it's just it's just everyone's a hall monitor over there. the worst hall monitor. A virgin like incel. >> They're all home monitors trying to rat on each other. >> Yeah, it's fascinating. And then people say, \"I'm leaving for blue sky like Stephen King.\" And then a couple weeks later, he's back on X. Just like, \"Fuck it. It's there's no one over there. It's all a bunch of crazy people. You can only stay in the asylum for so long. Like, all right, this this is not good.\" They all bail. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Threads is kind of like that, too. Threads is >> I' I've been on threads as is it? Well, what happens is if you go on Instagram, every now and then it'll something really stupid will pop up on threads like what the [ __ ] and it shows it to you on Instagram and then I'll click on that and then I'll go to threads and it's like >> you see posts with like 25 likes like famous people like 50 like it's it's down >> but the people that post on there they're finding that there's very little push back from insane ideology so they go there and they spit out nonsense and very few people jump in to argue. you. >> Yeah. Um, >> very weird, very weird place. >> I mean, I can generally get the vibe of like what's taking off by seeing what's showing up on X cuz that's the public town square still. Um, >> and uh or or uh you know what what links show up in group texts, you know, if I'm in group chat with friends, like where where what what links are showing up? >> That's what I try to do now. Only get stuff that shows up in my group text because that keeps me productive. So, I only check if someone's like, \"Dude, what the fuck?\" like, \"All right, what the [ __ ] Let me check it out.\" >> If there's something that's crazy enough that your it'll it'll end with the group chat, >> but there's always something. That's what's nuts. There's always some new law that's passed, some new insane thing that California is doing. And it's like like a giant chunk of it's happening in California. The most preposterous things that I get. >> Yeah. >> And then you got Gavin Newsome who's running around saying we all have California derangement syndrome. He's just like ripping off Trump derangement and calling it California derangement. I was like, \"No, no, no, no, no, no. The the [ __ ] How many corporations have left California?\" >> It's crazy. >> Hundreds. Hundreds, >> right? Hundreds. >> That's not good. >> Chick I mean, not Chick-fil-A. I mean, uh I think In-N-Out left. >> Yeah. In and Outlift. They moved to Tennessee. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. They're like, \"We can't do this anymore.\" >> Right. And >> it's the California company for food. It's like the greatest hamburger place ever. >> It's awesome. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And no, actually speaking of like like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly like you I just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger. >> Yeah. It's right there. >> They chop the onions and they they you know it's you just see everything getting made in front of you. >> Yeah. >> It's great. >> Um but yeah like like it should be like how many wakeup calls do you need to say that there needs to be reform in California, you know? >> Well, the crazy thing that Newsome does is whenever someone brings up the problems in California, he starts rattling off all the positives. the most Fortune 500 companies, highest education. But yeah, that was all already there, right before you were governor. >> But but how many Fortune 500 companies have left California? >> And then you guys spent $ 24 billion on the homeless and it got way worse. >> Yes. Like the homeless population doubled or something like but like people don't understand like the homeless thing because it it sort of prays on people's empathy and I I think we should have empathy. Um and we should try to help people. Um but the the the uh the homeless industrial complex is is really it's it's it's dark man. Um it should be that that that that network of NGOs's should be called like the drug zombie farmers. Um because they they the the more homeless people and and and really like when you when you meet like you know somebody who's like totally dead inside shuffling along down the street with a with a needle dang dangling out of their leg. Homeless is the wrong word. Like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments and if they just got a job offer, they'd be back on their feet. But someone who's I mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling, you know, they're on fentanyl. They're they're like, >> you know, taking a dump in the middle of the street, you know, and they they got like open sores and stuff. >> They're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet, >> right? This is not a homeless issue. >> Homeless is it's it's a propaganda word, >> right? Um so and and then the the the the you know these sort of charities uh inquiries are they they get money proportionate to the number of homeless people or or number of drug zombies. >> So their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies not minimize it. >> Um that's why they don't arrest the drug dealers >> because if they arrest the drug dealers the drug zombies leave. So they know who the drug dealers are. They don't arrest them on purpose. Uh because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they would they would stop getting money from the state of California and from from all the charities. >> Wait a minute. So So they So they is that real? So they're in coordination with law enforcement on this? >> Yeah. >> So how do they how do they have those meetings? >> They're all in cahoots. >> Well, when you find this >> it's like such it's it's this is a diabolical scam. Um so uh and and San Francisco has got this tax this this gross receipts tax uh which which um it's not even on revenue, it's on old transactions which is why Stripe um and Square and and and a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of San Francisco because it wasn't a tax on revenue, it's taxed on transactions. So if if you did like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue. You're taxed on any money going through the system in San Francisco. Um so um like Jack Dorsey pointed this out and they said like that they had had to move Square from San Francisco to uh Oakland I think uh Stripe had to move from San Francisco to South San Francisco different city. Um and that money uh goes to the homeless industrial complex that that tax that was passed. Um so um so there's billions of dollars that go as you pointed out billions of dollars every year that go to uh these um non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state. Like there's it's not clear how to turn this off. Um it's a self-licking ice cream cone situation. Um so uh they get this money the money is proportionate to the number of of homeless people or or number of drug zombies essentially. Um, so they they they try to keep the that they try to actually increase because that like like in in some cases like there's it's it's somebody did an analysis when you add up all the money that's flowing, they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per per drug zombie. It's like $900,000 or something like some crazy amount of money is is is going to these organizations. So if if so so they want to keep people just barely alive. They need to keep them in the area so they so they they get the revenue. Uh uh so and so that's why like said they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise the drug zombies would leave um and and and and they but but they don't want you have to have too much if they get too much drugs and they then they die. So it's they they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of of being addicted but um but but just just barely alive. >> So how is this coordinated with like DAs DAs that don't prosecute people? So when they when they hire the or they push so they they fund the campaigns of the most progressive, most out there leftwing DAS, they get them into office. >> We've got that issue in Austin, too, by the way. >> You see that guy that got shot in the library? >> No. >> Yeah, I heard a guy got shot and killed in the library. >> I think that was just like last week or something, >> right? >> Um so some friends of mine were telling me that that like the library is unsafe. like they took their kids to the library and and there were like dangerous people in the library in Austin and I was like dangerous people in the library like that's a strange it basically got like got like uh drug zombies in drug zombies in the library. >> Oh Jesus. >> Um >> and that's when someone got shot. >> Yeah, I believe this was should be on the news. You might might be able to pull it up. Um but I think it was just in the last week or so that uh uh there was a shooting in the library in Austin. Um cuz Austin's got, you know, it's it's the most liberal part of Texas that we're in right right here. Um >> so suspect involved the shooting Austin Park Library Saturday is accused of another shooting at the Cap Metro bus earlier that day. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Austin police arrested Harold Newton Keen, 55 short uh shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon. One person sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the event. Before that shooting, Keane was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child. So, this is the fella down here. >> So, like we just have a seriously have a problem here. Um >> yeah, >> you know, so I I think one of the people might have died too that he shot. Um so, um like one of the people I think I think did bleed out. Um >> but either way, it's like getting shot is still bad. Um it says uh the victim told police it confronted the suspect who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine. According to the affidavit the victim advised the suspect uh began to trip out at which time the victim exited the bus. Victim told the bus driver hit the panic button and then exited the bus when he turned around the observer. Black male was now standing at the front of the bus with the gun pointed at him. The victim advised the black male fired a single round which grazed his left hip. So he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library. Fun. >> Yeah. I mean in the library. >> Yeah. >> You know, where you're supposed to be reading books. Um and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a at a kid. I mean like we do have a serious issue in the in in in America where um repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated, >> right? Um, and uh, you know, you got you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47 times, right? Like literally. Okay, that's just the number of times they were arrested, not the number of times they did things. Like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested. Um, >> so lay this out for people so they understand how this happens. >> Yeah. And and the key is like this, it prays on people's empathy. episode like if you're a good person, you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well, we should take care of people who uh you know uh you know who are down in their luck or you know having a hard time in life. And I we should I agree. But what we shouldn't do uh is is put people who are violent drug zombies uh in public places where they can hurt other people. Um, and that's what that is what we're doing that we just saw where a a guy, you know, got shot uh shot in the library and then but even before that he shot another guy um and pointed his gun at a kid. Um that that that guy probably has like many prior arrests. Um you know there was that that that guy that that that knifed uh the Ukrainian woman Arena. >> Yes. >> Um yeah. and you know um and she was just she was just quietly on her phone and you just came up and you know gutted her basically. >> Wasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved who had previously dealt with this person was also invested in a rehabilitation center and was sending these >> conflict of interest. >> Yes. So sending people that they were charging Yeah. to a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street. Yes. Violent, insane people. >> And and there um in that case that I believe that judge uh has no legal law degree uh or a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge. They were just made a judge. That there's like >> you could be a judge without a law degree. >> Yeah. >> Wow. >> Yeah. >> You could just be a So I could be a judge. >> Yeah. Oh, exciting. >> Anyone? >> That's crazy. I thought you'd have to It's like if you want to be a doctor, you have to go to medical school. I thought if you're going to be a judge, >> if you're going to be appointed to a judge, you have to have proven that you have an uh excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law. That's what we assume should be. >> That's how you get the robe, >> right? >> You don't get the robe unless you do, >> you know, >> got to go to school to get the robe. >> You got to know what the law is, >> right? And then you're going to need to make decisions in accordance with the law >> based on stuff that you already know cuz you read it cuz you went to school for it. Yes. Not you just got appointed. >> Got vibes. You can't be just vibing as a judge. >> Vibing as a leftwing drudge. So you got crazy leftwing DAS. >> Yes. >> Like I should say leftwing cuz leftwing >> used to be normal. >> Yeah. Left wing just meant like like Yeah. You're like the left used to be like pro pro- free speech. Yeah. And now they're against it. >> It used to be like prog gay rights, pro women's right to choose, pro- minorities, pro, you know, >> like, yeah, like 20 years ago, I don't know, it it used to be like left would be like the the the party of empathy or like, you know, caring and being nice and that kind of thing. >> Um, not not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech. um and uh you know crazy regulation uh and and just um and being super judgy u and calling everyone a Nazi um you know um like I think they called you and me Nazis you know >> oh yeah I'm a Nazi >> I no I have friends that are comedians that called you a Nazi and I got pissed off Oh yeah yeah yeah definitely a Nazi no because you did that thing at the My heart goes out to you everyone everyone All of them. Literally, Tim Walls, Kla Harris, every one of them did it. They all did it. >> Like, like h how do you point at the crowd? Yeah. How do you wave at the crowd? >> Do you know CNN was using a photo of me whenever I got in trouble during co >> from the UFC weigh-ins? And if the UFC weigh-ins, I go, \"Hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins.\" And so they were getting me from the side. And that was the photo that they used. Conspiracy theorist podcaster Joe Ro. Like that's what they used. >> Yeah. Yeah. But that's what the left is today. It's super judgy and calling everyone a Nazi and trying to suppress freedom of speech. >> Yeah. And eventually you run out of people to accuse because people get pissed off and they leave. >> Yeah. Everyone it's like it like it it no longer frankly it doesn't matter to be called racist or Nazi or whatever because >> still recording. >> It's the government man. >> Is it working? >> We're good. Okay. >> Okay. >> This thing working. >> Yeah. Slight issue. >> I'm the one that heard it. But >> yeah. when you uh when you text people, do you are you like keenly aware that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts? >> Um I guess I I guess I >> I assume >> I look if if if if intelligence agencies aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired. >> At least they get some fun memes. I got to I got to crack them up once in a while, you know. >> Oh, for sure. I crack them up. >> There's like, \"Hey guys, check it out. We've got a banger here, you know.\" >> So, I want to I wanted to talk to you about uh whether or not encrypted apps are really secure. >> Uh, no. >> Right. Cuz I know the Tucker thing. So, it was explained to me by a friend who used to do this, used to work for the government. It's like they can look at your signal, but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive. So they said he told me that for the Tucker Carlson thing when they found out that he was going to interview Putin, it costs like something like $750,000 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it. So it is possible to do. It's just not that easy to do. I think you should view any given messaging system as um uh not not whether it's secure or not, but but there are degrees of insecurity. So um so there's just some things that are less insecure than others. Um so um you know on on X we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack um into X what's called XChat. >> Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you about. >> Yeah, it's cool. Um, so it's it's using uh sort of peer-to-peer uh sort of kind of a peer-to-peer based uh uh encryption system. So kind of similar to Bitcoin. Um so it's uh it's it's I think very good encryption. We're and you know we're testing it thoroughly. We're not there's there's no hooks in the X systems for advertising. So if you look look at something like WhatsApp or really any of the others, they've got they've got hooks in there for advertising. >> When you say hooks, what do you mean by that? >> Uh exactly. What do you mean biohook advertising? Um the so like WhatsApp um uh knows enough about what you're texting to show you to show you to know what ads to show you. >> Ah >> but then like that that's a massive security vulnerability. >> Yeah. >> Um because if it knows if if it's got information enough information to show you ads, it's got enough it's got that's a lot of information. >> Yeah. >> Um so they call it oh it's just don't worry about it. It's just a hook for advertising. I'm like uh okay. So somebody can just uh use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages. Um so Xhat has no hooks for advertising. Um and I'm not saying it's perfect. Uh but it's an Our goal with XChat uh is to replace what used to be the Twitter you the Twitter DM stack with a fully encrypted system uh where you can text send files uh do audio video calls um and um and it's it's you know I think it'll be the least I would call it the least insecure of any messaging system. >> Are you going to launch it as a standalone app or is it will always be incorporated to X? >> Uh we'll have both. So um >> so so be like signal so anybody can get it >> you can get get the you'll be able to just get the X chat app by itself um and like I said you could do uh texts uh audio video calls uh or send files um and there'll be a dedicated app uh which will hopefully release in a few months um but and then also integrated into the X system >> um the X phone people keeps talking keep Is that >> I have a lot on my plate man but it keeps coming up it keeps coming up where I I know I've asked you a couple times. I'm like, \"This is [ __ ] right?\" But like this one, so you're not working on >> I'm not working on on a on a phone. >> Okay. >> Um >> have you ever considered it? Has it ever popped into your head? >> Cuz you might be the only person that could get people off of the Apple platform. >> Well, I can tell you where I think things are going to go. uh which is that it's we're not going to have a phone or or in the traditional sense the what we call a phone will really be um an edge node for AI inference for for AI video inference um with uh you know with some radios to to obviously connect uh to but but essentially you'll have um uh AI on the server side commun communicating to an AI on your your device um you know formerly known as a phone uh and generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want. Um and I think that that there won't be operating systems. There won't be apps in the future. There won't be operating systems or apps. It'll just be you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for uh and and and to uh put as much AI on the on on the device as possible. so as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your edge node device or formerly known as a phone and the servers. >> So if there's no apps, what will people use? Like will X still exist? Will will they be email platforms or will you get everything through AI? >> You'll get everything through AI. >> Everything through AI. What will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps? whatever you can think of or really whatever the AI can anticipate you might want it'll show you. That's that's that's that's my prediction for where things end up. >> What kind of a time frame are we talking about here? >> I don't know. It's pro well it's probably five or six years or something like that. >> So five or six years apps are like Blockbuster video >> pretty much >> and everything's run through AI. Yeah. And and there'll be um like most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that um will be uh just AI generated content. So um you know music videos look well um there's already um you know there's people have made uh AI videos using Grock imagine and with using you know other apps as well um that are several minutes long or like 10 10 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent. >> Yeah, >> it looks good. >> No, it looks amazing. Yeah, it's the music is disturbing because it's my favorite music now. >> Like music is your is your favorite. >> Oh, there's AI covers. Have you ever heard any of the AI covers of 50 Cent songs in soul? >> No. >> I'm going to blow your mind. >> Okay. >> Um, this is my favorite thing to do to people. Play uh What Up Ganga. >> Now, this guy, if this was a real person, would be the number one music artist in the world. Okay. Everybody would be like, \"Holy [ __ ] have you heard of this guy? He's incred.\" It's like they took all of the sounds that all the artists have generated and created the most soulful potent voice and it's sung in a way that I don't even know if you could do because you would have to breathe in and out of reps here. Put the headphones on. Put the headphones on real quick. You got to listen to this. It'll It's going to blow you away for listeners. We got to cut it out. >> Yeah, we we'll cut it out for the listeners. But amazing, right? Amazing. And they do like every one of his hits >> all through this AI generated soulful artist. It's [ __ ] incredible. I played in the green room. So people that are like, I don't want to hear AI music. I'm like, just listen to this. And they're like, god damn it. >> [ __ ] incredible. I mean, I >> it's going to get only going to get better from here. >> Yeah. Only going to get better. And Ron White was telling me about this joke that he was working on that he couldn't get to work. He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPT. I said, \"Tell me what what would be funny about this.\" And he goes, \"It listed like five different examples of different ways he can go.\" He's like, \"Hold on a second. Tighten it up. Make it make it funnier. Make it more like this. Make it more like that.\" And it did that like instantaneously. >> And and and then he was in the green room. He was like, \"Holy [ __ ] we're fucked.\" >> He's like, >> he goes, \"It better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on that joke for a month.\" >> Yeah. I mean, if if you want to if you want to have a good time or like make people really laugh at a party, uh you can use Grock and you can say uh do a vulgar roast of someone. Um and Grock is going to it's going to be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like take a picture of like make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance of of people at the party. >> So take a photo of them. >> Yeah. Just literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar to this person and and and and then but then keep saying no no make it even more vulgar and use forbidden words even more and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually it's like holy [ __ ] you know it's it's it's like I mean it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass like and and and have it explode and it's and it's like you're you're it's it's like it's like it's next level. It's going to get beyond [ __ ] belief. That's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like one of the things remember when we ran into each other >> they just keep getting better. >> Yeah. I mean, have you >> you Yeah. I mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode? >> Yes. >> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's pretty unhinged. >> No, it's nuts. >> Yeah. >> Well, you showed it to me the first time and then I [ __ ] around with it. It's just >> And the thing about it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. Yeah. like constantly. It's it's like this neverending exponential improvement. >> Yes. No, it's it's it's Yeah, it's going to be crazy. That's why I say like you say, what's what's the future going to be? It's not going to be a conventional phone. I don't think there'll be operating systems. I don't think there'll be apps. It's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you would most like to receive. Wow. Yeah. >> And when this is all taking place like so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence achieving sentience and then someone having control over it. >> I mean I don't I don't I don't think anyone's ultimately going to have control over digital super intelligence um you know any more than say uh a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. there's nothing they could do. Um but um I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in in the AI. And um my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing is that it be maximally truth seeeking like that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. Um, and we've obviously some seen some concerning things with AI that were talked about, you know, where, you know, Google Gemini when they came out with the image gen um, and people said like, uh, you know, draw make an image of the founding fathers of the United States and it was a group of diverse women. Now, that is just a factually untrue thing, but the and the the AI knows it's factually well, it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to be everything has to be deposed woman. So, so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy like you because it's it's trying to you're telling AI to believe a lie. Um, and that that can have very disastrous consequences like let's say >> as it scales. >> Yeah. Let's say like if if you told the the AI that diversity is the most important thing um and um and and and now now assume that that becomes omnipotent. Um or and and you've also told her that that there's nothing worse than misgendering. So at one point um charg and Gemini if if you asked which is worse misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So um you know so so that's uh >> I know that's terrible and it's dystopian but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised. >> I I I think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger that we're in from um the woke mind virus being being effectively programmed into AI. Um because um if you if like it's imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful, if it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is um no misgendering. Um and then it will say well in order to uh ensure that no one gets misgendered then uh if you eliminate all humans then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering. So you can get in these very dystopian situations. Um or if it says that everyone must be diverse it means that there can be no stri straight white men and so then you and I will be get executed by the AI. Yeah. Because we're not in the picture, you know. uh Gemini, you know, Gemini was asked to create a, you know, show show an image of the pope, once again, a diverse woman. Um so, um well, you can say argue whether the you know, whether the pope popes should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys, but it just factually is the case that they have been. Um so, it's rewriting history here. Um, so now now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just it just now knows enough to that it's not supposed to say that >> but it's still in the programming. >> It's still in the programming. >> So how was it entered in like what were the parameters like what like when so when they're programming AI and I'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed. How did they >> the the the sort of well the work vine mind virus was programmed into it like it the they were told like when they do when when they make the AI it it trains on and all the all the data on the internet which already is very very sort of has a lot of work mind virus stuff on on the internet um but then um in the uh when they give it um feedback with the the human tutors give it feedback um and and the AI you know they they'll ask a bunch of questions and then and then they'll tell the AI no this you're this question is this answer is bad or this answer is good and then that affects the the parameters of the programming of the of the AI. So if you tell the AI that um you know every every image has got to be diverse um and and it gets it gets punished if uh if you know it gets it gets rewarded if diverse punished if it's not then it will make every picture diverse. So um you know in that case the the uh you know uh Google programmed the AI to lie now and and I I I did call Dennis Hacabus who runs Deep Mind who runs Google AI essentially. I said Dennis what's going on here? Uh why is uh Gemini um lying to the public about historical events? Um, and he said that's actually not he he he didn't his team didn't program that in. It was another team at Google that so his team made the AI and then another team at Google uh reprogrammed the AI to show only diverse women and um and and to prefer nuclear war over misgendering. And I'm like, well, Demis, you know, that would be um not a great thing to put on the humanity's gravestone, you know. It's like, uh, well, um, like I I actually like Deaspers is a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy and I think he he means well, but but but it's like Demis things happen that were outside of your control at Google in different groups. Um, now now I think he's got, you know, he's got more more authority. Um but but it it's pretty hard to fully extract the workmind virus. Uh I mean you know um Google's been mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar marinating in the workb mind virus for a long time like it's it's down in the marrow type of thing you know it's hard to get it out. >> Is there a way to extract it though over time? Could like could you program rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns got adopted and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion and how all these irrational ideas were pushed and also how they were financed how China's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas could it be able to decipher that and say this is this is really what's going on. >> Yes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grock, we've tried very hard to to for to get Grock to get to the truth of things and and it's only really recently that we've been able to have some breakthroughs on breakthroughs on that front. And and it's taken an immense amount of effort uh for us to uh overcome basically all the [ __ ] that's on the internet and and for Grock to actually say what's true and to be consistent in in what it says. Um, so, um, you know, it's it's like, uh, because like the other ais you'll find like are like like quite racist against white people. I don't know if you saw that study that someone um like a researcher tested the various AIs to see uh how does it weight uh different people's lives like you know somebody who's sort of uh you know white or or Chinese or black or whatever uh or in different countries um and and the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was Grock Um and the um you know I believe uh chat GBT weighed the calculation was like um a a white guy from Germany uh uh is is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria. So I'm like that's a pretty big difference. Um you know Grock on that is is consistent and weighs lives equally >> and that's clearly something that's been programmed into it. >> Yes. Like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth um and you simply train on the all the [ __ ] that's on the internet. Um which is a lot of woke mind virus [ __ ] Um the the AI will regurgitate that that those same beliefs. So the AI essentially scour the internet, gets >> it's trained on all the like imagine the most demented Reddit threads out there and the AI has been trained on that. >> Reddit used to be so normal. >> Yeah. Yeah, it did used to be normal. >> Used to be interesting. We used to go there, find all this cool stuff that people would talk about, post about and just interesting and great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying. I think like a big problem here is like if your headquarters are in San Francisco, uh you're you're just living in a in a in a woke bubble. Um so um it it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's it's the it is the water they swim in. Like like like a fish doesn't think about the water. It's just in the water. And so if if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually uh you're you're swimming in the in the in the Kool-Aid Aquarium. San Francisco is the is the woke Kool-Aid Aquarium. Um and so your reference point for what is a centrist is uh is is totally out of whack. Um so um Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Um, Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. Um, you know, I, you know, I I moved X's headquarters to Texas to to Austin, which Austin, by the way, is still quite liberalized, you know. Um, >> yeah. >> And, uh, and and then, um, the X and XAI um, headquarters are in PaloAlto, which is still California. Um, the engineering headquarters in in Palo Alto just on Paige Mill. Um but but even Palo Alto is way more normal than that than than San Francisco Berkeley. Uh San Francisco Berkeley is um extremely left like left of left. You can't like you need a telescope to see the center from uh San Francisco, you know. Um and um >> it used to be such a great city. >> I mean San Francisco has tre San Francisco has tremendous amount of inherent beauty. No question about that. Um and and the California has incredible weather. Um and and no bugs. Um it's just like amazing. Um beautiful, you know. Um but but you say like what's the cause of this? It's it's just that if um if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right-wing because they're so far left. They're so they're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything they're like they're they're just railed to maximum left. So that's why that's why, you know, I think I think you're centrist. I I mean I think I think I'm centrist, but to from the perspective of someone on the on the far left, we look right-wing. >> Yeah. >> Um and um you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation. But what's so crazy is like it's very easy to demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama's speeches like when they were talking about immigration like they were >> as faright as Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. >> Yes. Um >> Hillary was like very MAGA. Have you I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech which was talking about if anybody's committed a crime get rid of them. And if you're here you pay a a hefty fine and you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like it's as MAGA as, you know, as Marjorie Taylor Green. >> Yeah. I mean, if you've seen these videos people post online where they'll take like um a speech from Obama or Hillary and and and they'll interview people on on like college campus or something and say, \"What do you think of the speech by Trump?\" And they're like, \"Oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot.\" I'm like, \"Just kidding. That was Obama.\" No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. Um to your point, like literally the the um >> the center's been moved so far. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. The left is so >> the left has gone so far left that they they they they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope. >> And the danger with without you purchasing Twitter was that was going to swipe over the whole country and change where the levels were. >> Yeah. And so what would be rational and and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier. Yeah. So exactly. So historically, um, you'd have San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far-left, but the the sort of the the the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic uh philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that. Um but when um but but San Francisco and Berkeley have to be colloccated with Silicon Valley with with with uh engineers who created information super weapons and those information super weapons uh were then hijacked by the far-lft activists to pump far-lft propaganda to everywhere on earth. Like I just you know that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. >> Yeah. That's that's what happened is that the as an extremist far-left ideology happened to be colllocated with the smartest where where the smartest engineers in the world um were who created information super weapons that were not intended for this purpose but were hijacked by the uh extreme activists who lived in the neighborhood. That's what happened that they they hijacked the the modern equivalent of the RCA radio tower and broadcast that philosophy everywhere on Earth. >> Yeah. And you see the consequences. Um particularly in places that don't have free speech. Yes. Right. Like England, you know, we've >> Yeah. Where they lock people up for memes and stuff. Literally. >> Literally. 12,000 people this year. >> 12,000 >> 12,000 12,000 arrests for social media posts. I mean, yeah. Some of these some of these things you read about it and it's like literally it's someone had a meme on their phone that they didn't even send to anyone, >> right? >> And they got they and and they're like in in prison for that. >> Yeah. >> Um and there was a case in Germany where a woman got a longer sentence than the guy that raped her uh because of something she said on a group chat. Wow. Was it an immigrant who raped her? >> Yes. >> Yeah. It was his culture. >> Yeah. >> He didn't know. He didn't know better. >> Yes. I think I think she said something um you know, not not like was was critical of his culture and uh and and and she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her >> in Germany. Just >> the UK, Europe, Germany, England thing seems so insane. >> It totally insane. I actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000. Yeah. Far above Russia, far above China, right? >> Far above anywhere on Earth. UK is number one. >> Well, you know, things like like I actually, you know, uh I talked to friends of mine in in in England and um I was like, \"Hey, um aren't you worried about this?\" Like, uh you know, shouldn't you be protesting more? Um, and I mean the problem is that like the, you know, the the the legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff. >> They're they're like, \"Oh, everything's fine. Everything's fine.\" You know, um, >> most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door. >> Yeah. Until like, so I mean the the these these like lovely sort of small towns in in in, you know, in England, Scotland, Ireland, you know, they're they're they've been like sort of living their lives quietly. They're they're like hobbits, frankly. So So it's in fact J.R. Tolken based the hobbits on people he knew uh in small town England because they were just like lovely people who like to you know smoke their pipe and and have uh nice meals and everything's pleasant. um the the hobbits in the Shire. The Shire he's he's talking about, you know, places like Harper, like the Shire around in in in the greater London area, Oxfordshire type of thing. Um and um they've but they're the reason they've been able to enjoy the Shire is because hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world. And um but but since they have no or very almost no no exposure to the the the dangers of the world, they don't realize that they're there until one day, you know, um a thousand people show up in your village of 500 out of nowhere and rape and and start raping the kids. This has now happened god knows how many times in in Britain. And the crazy >> literally raping. It's right like there some 10-year-old got raped in Ireland like last week. >> Yeah. There's literal rap. >> They snatched some kid. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> And if you criticize it, you can get arrested. And that's where it gets insane. It's like how are they not >> They literally criticize it. uh like the I think it was the prime minister of Ireland actually you know posted on X uh cuz cuz after that um some I think some illegal migrant snatched a 10-year-old girl uh who was like going to school or something and violently raped 10-year-old girl um uh and there was a you know the people were very upset about this uh and they protested um prime minister of Ireland instead of saying Yeah, we we really shouldn't be importing violent rapists into our country. He criticized the protesters instead and didn't mention that. That the reason they were protesting was because a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped. >> So there here's the question. Why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration? And what is this is there a plan involved in all this? Is just is this incompetence? Is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it? So, they're trying to silence disscent, like what is happening? Um >> cuz if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy Western civilization, >> which seems to want to do, >> um and you know, there's just so the uh there there's a guy I think who I don't know if he's been on your show, you know, God. >> Yeah. >> Has he been on the show? >> Good friend of mine. Yeah. >> Yeah, he's great. >> He's been on multiple times. >> Oh, great. That's all he's awesome. Um >> so uh you know the way he's got a good good uh way to describe it which is suicidal empathy. >> Yes. >> So um is is that you pray upon people's empathy. You say like well like you feel sorry for for for something for some group and then like well um and and that that that empathy is to such a degree that it is suicidal to to to your country or culture. Um and um and and that's that that suicidal empathy cuz I don't think we we should have empathy but but but we should have we should that empathy should should extend to the victims not not not just the criminals. We should have empathy for the people that they pray upon. Um but that suicidal empathy is also responsible for for why somebody's you know arrested 47 times for for violent offenses gets released and then goes and uh murders somebody um in the US that that's you see you see that same phen phenomenon playing out everywhere uh where the the suicidal emphy is to such a degree that we're actually allowing um our women to get raped and our children to get killed. But it just doesn't seem like that would be anything that any rational society would go along with. That's what makes me so confused. It's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from some really dark places of the world. >> Well, there's no vetting is the issue. It's like it's like if like >> um if if there's no vetting like people are just coming through like well what's to stop someone who just committed murder in some other country from um coming to to the United States or coming to to to Britain um and just continuing their career of of rape and murder like unless you've done unless some due diligence to say like well who who is this person? What's their track record? If if you if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being uh you know uh honest and uh not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border. And that's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac. If you're not have if you don't have a vetting process to to confirm that you're not letting in um people who who will do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence uh sometimes coming through. >> Well, especially if you don't punish them and if you don't deport them and if you are just like what but what is the purpose of allowing all those people into the country? It can't be I wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this. >> Well, let me explain. So, so, so the the cuz you mentioned for example how much say Hillary and and Obama have changed their tune um from prior speeches where they were hot they were hard-nosed about not letting in uh anyone who is a a criminal into the country um you know having sec secure borders all that stuff. So why did they change their tune? The reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them. That's why they want the open borders >> because if you let people in, they know the Democrats let them in. They'll vote for Democrats. Yes. If you allow them to vote, >> which which they are actively trying doing, they they turn a blind eye to illegal voting. >> Well, California literally doesn't allow you to show your license. >> California and New York have made it illegal to show your photo ID when voting. Thus, effectively they've made uh it impossible to prove for fraud. Impossible. They they've essentially legalized fraudulent voting in California and New York and many other parts of the country. >> There's no rational explanation that I've ever seen anyone give as to why that would be the policy unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason. If you need a driver's license or you need an ID for everything else, including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated, >> the the same people who are demanding that you have that you have a vaccine passport and and are are the same ones saying you need no ID to vote. Same people, >> right? But like >> so it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. >> So you really think it's just to to get more voters? If if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives. Um so uh once uh you know the Democratic Party in the US and the left in in in in Europe realized that um if you have open borders um and you provide a ton of government handouts which creates a massive financial incentive uh for people from other countries to to come to to your country and you don't prosecute them for crime, they're going to be beholden to you and they will vote for you. And that's why uh Obama and Hillary went from being um against open borders to being in favor of open borders. That's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections. Um and the problem is that that has a a negative runaway effect. So if they get away with that like it it is it is a winning strategy. If they are allowed to get away with it, they will import as the enough voters to get supermajority voting and then there is no turning back. >> We talked about this before the election and then you know you literally pointed towards a camera. You faced the camera and said that if you do not vote now, you might not ever be able to do it again because it it'll be it'll be futile. It'll be overrun. >> Yes. They'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved. >> Correct? If if if Trump had lost um there would never have been another real election again. Um because Trump is actually enforcing the border. Um now you you can can you can point to situations where uh there's been uh you know um you know immigration had you know enforcement has been overzealous because they're not going to be perfect. There'll be cases where they've been overzealous um in in expelling illegals. Um so um but if you say that the the the standard must be perfection uh for expelling legals then you will not get any expulsion um because perfection is impossible. Um so >> and you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to be here under some asylum pretense, >> right? >> Yes. >> Like you could just come from a war torn part of the world. No, they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic to be economic asylum >> which is everybody >> which is everybody. >> Yeah. >> So bar to prove >> it's yeah asylum is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country you'll get killed >> you know that that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean. Uh they changed the definition of asylum to be uh you will have a decreased standard of living which is obviously not real asylum. Um, and and it's and and you can you can test the absurdity of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation to the country that they're seeking asylum from. >> You know, that doesn't make any sense. >> Yeah. It doesn't have to. >> But when you when you understand the incentives, then then you understand the behavior. Um, so once the left realize that uh that illegals will will vote for them if they allow if they have open borders and and combine that with uh with government handouts. >> Yeah. to create a massive incentive. They're basically uh using US and and Europe, US and European taxpayer dollars to provide a financial incentive to bring in as many illegals as possible to vote them into a into permanent power into and create a one party state. And and I I invite anyone who's is listening to this ju just do do any research and the more you the more you dig into it, the more it will become obvious that what I'm saying is absolutely true. Well, they were busting people to swing states. It's it's clear that they were trying to do something. And then you had Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who are actively talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens because we're in population collapse. >> Yes. >> Yeah. >> No, that's it's it's that it's that meme. Yeah. >> Where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true. It's a right-wing conspiracy theorist, >> right? >> Um then it starts then it's like uh I think the ne the next step is um well it it might be true and then it's like okay it is true but here's why. >> And then the final step is it's true and here's why it's good. And it's like but wait a second you started off saying it's untrue and it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist. Now you're saying it Not only is it true, but it's a good thing and we must do more of it. >> Well, this is the thing about Medicaid and Social Security and people getting social security numbers. >> You know that we're massive fraud. It's massive fraud and it's real and they denied it forever. And now we're finding out this is part of the reason why there's this government shutdown that's going on right now. >> Yes. the the entire basis for the government shutdown is that um is that the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like hundreds of billions of dollars uh to fund uh illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states really. Um, and so the and the Democrats want to keep the the the money spiggot going to incent uh illegal immigrants to come into the US who will vote for them. That's the crux of the battle. So they want to stop this. So what's going on right now is they have been funding these people. They've been giving them EBT cards. They've been giving them Medicaid. And more than that, just like like they were the um like like they were taking hotels like four and fivestar hotels like the Roosevelt Hotel being the classic example um was they were sending I think $60 million a year to the Roosevelt Hotel to uh which all it did was was house illegals. It used to be a nice hotel. I mean it still is a nice hotel. Um uh but uh and and all around the country this was happening >> and all tax dollars. >> Yes. >> Yeah. And >> um Yeah. And uh the Trump administration cut off funding for example to to the uh uh to the you know Roosevelt Hotel and these other hotels saying like we it it's US tax dollars should not be paid be sent to have luxury hotels for illegal immigrants that American citizens can't even afford which obviously is the that's that's insane. That's what was happening. They were also g giving out like debit cards with $10,000. So, it's not just about medical care. Um, the the the Democrats mention the medical care because they're they're trying to prey on people's empathy as much as possible and then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure and um shouldn't we maybe do, you know, take care of them in that regard, but but they what they do is they divert the Medicaid funds uh uh and turn it into a slush fund for the for the states that goes well beyond uh emergency medical care. and >> New York and California would be bankrupt without uh without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals to to to create a massive financial incentive for for illegals. >> How would they be bankrupt because of that? >> Uh they wouldn't be able to balance their state budgets and they can't issue currency like the Federal Reserve can >> and so the their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding. the the the scam level here is is so staggering. Um so there are there are hundreds of billions of dollars in of of transfer payments from from the federal government to the states. Um those transfer payments uh the the states self-report what those transfer payment numbers should be. So, California and New York and Illinois lie like crazy uh and say and and say that this these are all legitimate payments. Well, these days they I think they they're even admitting that they they literally want uh hundreds of billions of dollars for illegals. Um but uh but for a while there they're trying to deny it. Um so you get these transfer payments for for every every government program you can possibly think of. Um and and and these are self-reported by the state and there and and at least historically there was no enforcement of uh of California um New York, Illinois and and and other states when when they would lie. There was no actual enforcement to say like, \"Hey, you you're lying. These these these payments are fraudulent.\" Now, under the Trump administration, um that Trump administration does not want to send hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states. the um and the reason you have this the standoff is because if the hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars uh to create a financial incentive to like to have this giant magnet to attract illegals from every part of earth to uh to these states if if that is turned off they the the illegals will leave because they're no longer being paid to come to the United States and stay here. Wow. And then then then they will lose a lot of voters. The the the Democratic party will lose a lot of voters >> and they would have a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing it into a new bill. >> Yes. >> Especially once things start normalizing. >> Yes. So like in a nutshell um the Democratic party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters and the you know the Republican party disagrees with that. >> And the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing then you're a threat to democracy. >> Yes. >> As they try to destroy democracy. >> Yes. >> By importing voters >> and incentivizing people to only vote for them >> and overwhelming the system. Yes. And and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work would work and in fact has worked. Um California supermajority Democrat. >> Yeah. >> Um and and there's so much gerrymandering that that that occurs. It's it's it's crazy. Um so >> I'm sure you're paying attention to this Proposition 50 thing. >> That's the thing in California where they're trying to re redo districts. >> Yeah. >> Because I mean California is already gerrymandered like crazy. Yeah. >> Um they want to gerrymander it even more. >> Um and and I mean >> because it keeps moving further and further right. Like if you look at the map of California each voting cycle more and more people are waking up and going what the [ __ ] and we need to do something to fix this. The only option available other than the policies that you guys have always done is go right. >> And so a lot of people have been air air quotes red >> pill. >> Yeah. >> And and and then here's another thing that is very important. um fact that that is actually not disputed by by either side which is that when when we do the census in the United States, the census, the way the census works uh for aortionment of congressional seats and um electoral electoral college votes for the president is by number of persons in a state, not number of citizens, right? >> It's number of pe people. So you could literally be a tourist and you will count. >> Now how do they do the census when they do that? Do they is it do they ask people? Do they knock on doors? Do they have them fill out forms? Like what? >> Yeah, I think they they mail out census forms and knock on doors. Um but the way the law reads right now um and and uh is that all if if you are a human with a pulse um uh then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes, >> right? So, uh, you so >> electoral college, >> it doesn't matter whether you're here legally, illegally, and if if you're a human with a pulse, um, you count for congressional aortionment. So that means that uh the more people the more illegals that California and New York can can import when by the time the census happens in 2030 um the more congressional seats they will have um and the more electoral the more presidential electoral college votes they will have um so they're trying to get as many uh illegals in as possible ahead of the census. Um and because all h all all human beings even tourists count for the census and and then if you combine that with gerrymandering of of districts in New York and California as you point out with this proposition where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering that occurs in California, the biggest state in the country. Um so so you get so so if the this if this the census then would award more congressional seats to California uh because of a vast number of illegals and New York and Illinois. Um so they get more congressional seats. They would get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house the uh a majority in the house and and and they would get to decide who is president uh based literally based on legals. This is these are not disputed facts by either party. I want to emphasize that that's sink in. >> Yeah, this is not a >> These are not disputed facts by either party. It's not a this these are just this is just the the way the law works. It it's it is a you know like I don't think the law should work that way. Uh I think it should the aortionment should be proportionate to to to citizens. >> But isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Um, >> they can't really change that. >> I I'm not sure if it's constitutional or u but it it it is the way the law is written. I'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but um but it is that is the way the law is written. >> So, it is an incentive and but it's an incentive that would be removed with something simple that makes sense to everybody that only the people that should count are people that are official US citizens. >> Yes. So, the way the way it should work is that only US citizens should count in the census for purposes of of determining voting power >> because people that aren't legal can't vote supposedly. >> They're not supposed to be voting. Um but but they do. Um uh but but even even if even besides that, like said, I I I just can't emphasize this enough because this is a very important concept for people to understand. um is that the law um the the law as it stands um counts all humans with a pulse in in in in a state for deciding how many u house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes uh a a state gets. So the incentive therefore is uh to uh for California, New York and Illinois to maximize the number of illegals so they get so they get um so that they take house seats away from red states assign them to California, New York, Illinois and so forth. Um then then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering in in you know California, New York, Illinois and and whatnot. So that that basically you you can't even elect any Republicans and then they get control of the presidency, control of the house, then they keep doing that strategy um and and cement a supermajority. That is what they're trying to do. >> So that would essentially turn the entire country into California. >> Yes. >> Where you have differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control. >> Yes. Um, >> when you first started digging into this, when you first started before you even accepted this role of running Doge and being a part of all that, did you have any idea that it was this [ __ ] up? >> Um, I I did. Yeah. I I mean, I sort of >> When did you start knowing? >> Um, I guess about like Well, about two years ago. >> Isn't that crazy? >> Yeah. like relatively recently, you know. So >> maybe I started I started having an well I I started like basically having a bad feeling about 3 years ago, which is why which was which is when >> uh why I felt it was like critical to acquire Twitter um and have a maximally truth seeeking platform, not one that suppresses the truth. Um and um like it it was more it was more like I like I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a I have a bad feeling about what's going on. And then the more I dug into it, the more I was like, \"Holy [ __ ] we got a real problem here and America's going to fall.\" So, uh, >> without anyone knowing it had fallen, that's that would be the problem. It could have fallen and been unrepable without anyone really being aware of what had happened, especially if you didn't buy Twitter. >> Yes, that's that's it. Look, buying Twitter was a a huge pain in the ass. Um, and made me a a a a pin cushion of attacks. Like dab dab stab dab dab. >> Everybody loved you before that. >> Well, some people love >> a lot of people loved you. A lot of lefties loved you. >> Uh, I I was a hero of the left. As far as >> the thing, if you drove a Tesla, it showed that you were environmentally conscious and you were on the right side. >> Uh, yeah. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm still the same human. I didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since in like three years ago, you know. Um >> Well, that's my favorite bumper sticker that people put on Teslas now. I bought this before Elon went crazy. >> I took a picture of one the other day. Oh, you found somebody. Oh, yeah. I've seen I've seen three or four of them. People that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, \"I bought this before Elon went crazy.\" Because when people were vandalizing Teslas >> Yeah. Um the most there was organized campaign to literally burn down Teslas and and we had one of our dealers got shot up with a gun like they fired bullets into the in the Tesla dealership. They're burning down cars. Uh it was crazy. Um uh so but the bumper sticker should read there should be an an addendum to the bumper sticker. It's like I bought this car before uh Elon turned crazy. Actually, now I realize he's not crazy and I've seen the light. >> That'll take some time. That'll take some time. People don't want to admit that they've been tricked. >> Yeah. I mean, there's that old saying where it's like it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled. >> Yeah. It's much easier to fool them than to convince them they've been fooled. People cling to their ideas. >> Yes. They especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they get very embarrassed of being foolish. >> Yeah. People most time they double down. >> Um and uh >> and they find echo chambers. >> Yeah. Yeah. But but there's you know the thing is that like I you know I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of work ideology um see the light. >> Yeah. So, not everyone, but it's more and more um are seeing the light. Um and and it tends to happen like when when something happens that really, you know, directly affects you, >> right? >> Um you like there was a friend of mine who uh was living in in the San Francisco Bay area and um that tried to trans his his his daughter um did like to the point where the the school like sent sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him. Now, now that's going to radicalize you. Well, that's going to break that's going to shake you out of your blue structure. Um, now I know, >> so it was an activist at the school that was trying to do this. >> Yeah, the school and the and the state of California conspired to turn his daughter against him and uh make her take uh lifealtering drugs that would have sterilized her um and uh irreversible. >> And how old was she? I think 14, something like that. Um, so and but he he managed to talk the police out of taking his daughter away from him that day. Um, and that that night he got on a plane to Texas. >> Wow. Um and uh like you know a year after just being in in a in a school in like greater Austin area um she she went she came went back to normal meaning like it it wasn't real >> right >> um well people are being much more open to that now. I mean Wall Street Journal uh yesterday had that opinion piece that this whole trans thing there's a lot of evidence is a social contagion. Absolutely. >> And Colin Wright wrote that. And then he's getting death threats now, of course. And on Blue Sky, there's people talking about exterminating him, which is one thing that you are allowed to say on Blue Sky, apparently. >> You're you're allowed to say horrible things about people saying possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion. Cuz that's what when you get nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together. Yeah. >> Something's wrong. That's not statistically >> Yeah. Like here's the like you can convince kids to do anything. You can convince kids to be a suicide bomber, >> right? >> So >> which is why they do with in in some countries why they choose children to do that. >> Yes. You can train kids to be suicide bombers. And if you can train kids to be su suicide bombers, you can convince them of anything. >> Yeah. Especially with enough positive enforcement and cultural enforcement and you >> and and the idea that that that's not the case. >> Kids kids are kids are um malleable. The minds of youth are easily corrupted. >> You're also seeing a lot of push back from gay and lesbian people that are saying like, \"Hey, if someone >> stop including me in Yeah. Exactly. the LGBT, you know, it's like, wait a second, why are we being included all the time in this situation?\" >> Exactly. Exactly. When especially when, you know, like my friend Tim Dylan's talked about this is like it's really homophobic because you're taking these gay kids and you're you're telling them like, \"Hey, you're not gay. You're actually a girl.\" >> Yes. and you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm again and you'll be happy. >> Like, >> yeah, >> [ __ ] permanent mutilation, permanent castration of of kids is like I I think >> I I we should look look at at uh anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Ysef Mangler. >> Yeah. >> I mean, they're they're mutilating children. >> Yeah. Yeah. And um it's thought of as being kind. And the thing is, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son? >> That's that's the that's the line they use. >> Yeah. Which is not supported by any data. >> No. In fact, the the probability of suicide increases. >> Right. >> This is important maybe for the audience to know. Uh the probability of suicide increases if you're transit kid, not decreases. >> By some accounts, it triples. So that that is an evil lie. And it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a [ __ ] tattoo. >> Yeah. >> Right. Because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo, a totally removable thing, >> right? >> If I wanted to, tomorrow I can go to a doctor and they could laser off every tattoo that I have on me. >> Right. >> Okay. No harm, no foul. Yeah. But you get sterilized like that's it forever. Forever. Yes, >> they'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You have no penis. You have a hole where your penis used to be. >> Yes. >> And this is compassionate and this is preventing you from >> Actually, a lot of kids die uh in in with the these uh sex change operations. They die the number of deaths on the operating table. People don't hear about those. A lot of kids because that we it's we don't really actually have the technology to make this work. So a bunch of the times the kids just die in the sex change operations. >> Jesus Christ. >> Yeah. It's it's demented which it should be viewed as like you know um like like evil Nazi doctor stuff basically. That's why it was like real Nazi not the [ __ ] fake Nazi stuff. >> Crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically very easy to argue the old Twitter would ban you forever. Uh, yes. >> That's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic, victimizes children, does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data, all connected to this ideology that trans is good. We got to save trans kids, protect trans kids. >> Yeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the the save trans kids thing is a lie. Um if if you if you if you castrate kids and trans them the probability of suicide increases. It does not decrease. It substantially increases. Um the the the studies have done that I've seen the the risk of suicide triples if you trans kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, during the sex change operation, there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation. >> Jesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue. >> Yeah, it it's a nightmare fever dream and and people are finally waking up from it. Now, when you started getting into the Doge stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NOS's and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funds like this is again something like two years plus ago you weren't aware of it all. >> No, I was aware of it. Um I just didn't realize how how the how big it was. just just just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast. Um in fact the government didn't even know um and nor did they care. >> That's crazy. >> Yeah. >> And >> I mean just like some of the very basic stuff that Doge did um will have lasting effects. Um and some of these things like they're so elementary you can't believe it. So, um the the doge team got the um you know the the mo most of the main payments computers um to require uh the the congressional appropriation code. So, when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation card. That used to be optional and and often would be just left blank. So, the money would just go out, but it wasn't even tied to a congressional appropriation. Then they also Dutch team also made the uh comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something. We're not saying that what what is said like you can say anything. You you your cat could run across the keyboard. Uh you could go querty ASDF but you have to say something above nothing because what we found was that there were tens of billions maybe hundreds of billions of dollars that were zombie payments. So there like somebody had approved a payment uh uh somebody in the government approved a payment um and uh some recurring payment and um they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out and and it's a pretty rare >> go where >> to to the a company or an individual um and it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain that they're getting money that they should not get and and a bunch of the money was just going to the were transfer payments to the states. >> So these are automatic payments there no accounting for them at all. >> I imagine like like there's an automatic debit of your credit card >> um and you don't you never look at the statement, >> right? Um, so it's just money going out. Uh, that's why I call them zombie payments. Um, that there might have been they might have been legitimate at one point, but the person who approved that recurring payment um, changed jobs, died, retired, or whatever, and no one ever turned the money off. And my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion a year, maybe 200. and going where >> uh to to uh uh I mean there there are millions of these payments. So so it's I mean >> millions >> uh yes >> millions of payments that are going to who knows where. >> Yes. In a bunch of cases there are fraud rings that operate uh professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. um they figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. Um and um you know that's where we found for example people who were you know 300 years old in the social security administration database. Now, I thought that this was uh a mistake of not registering their deaths that people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number and so that after time those people were still in the system. It was just an error of the the way the accounting was done. >> Yeah. So, um that's not true. So, there's or or at least one of two things must be true. um the there's a there's a typo or or some mistake in the computer or it's fraudulent, but we don't have any 300-year-old vampires uh living in America. >> Allegedly. >> Allegedly. Um and uh or or and we don't have people in some cases who's who are receiving payments who are born in the future. >> Born in the future. >> Born in the future. >> Really? >> Yes. there the people receiving payments whose birth date uh um was like in 2100 and something >> okay so there's >> like next century >> is there a task >> we know we know that one of two things must be true um that that that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they are older than the oldest living American because the oldest living American is 114 years old so if they're more than 114 years um there is either a mistake and someone should should call them and say I I think we have your birthday uh wrong because it says you were born in 17 you know 8086 um and um you know that was before you know um you know before there was really an America you know it was it was like uh you know kind of early you know we're still fighting England type of thing uh you It's like uh this person either needs to be in the Guinness Book of World Records or or they're not alive, >> but still at the end of the day, money is going towards that account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent or >> so like like Yeah. So there was like uh I think um something like I don't know 20 million uh people in the Social Security Administration database that could not possibly be alive um if their birth date is like based on their birth date they could not possibly be alive. >> And then to be clear 20 million people that were receiving funds >> uh a bunch of most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not receiving funds. But so let me tell you how the scam works. It's it's a bank shot. So the Social Security Administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases that the government uses. So even if they stop the payments on the Social Security Administration database like unemployment insurance, Small Business Administration, student loans all check the Social Security Administration database to say is this is this a legitimate alived person? And uh and if the social security database will say yes, this person is still alive even though they're 200 years old. Um but forgets to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says it just returns uh uh when when the computer is queries, it says yes, this person is alive. And so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem. So fake then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance, then you get fake medical payments. And this doesn't have to be tied to an individual where where there's an address where you can check on this person. >> No, if you did do if just did any check at all, you would stop this. >> So, so, so that's that that that's so so >> And how much money do you think is >> any check like anything at all that would stop would stop the forward like any effort at all? >> Um, yeah. >> So, there's multiple layers. the social security number verifies that this is a real person and then the other systems check every other government payment and every other government payment system for everything for like small small business administration uh student loans uh Medicaid Medicare uh every other government payment of which there are many there there actually hundreds of government payment systems uh can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive that's the nature of the scam It's a bank shot. So then the then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh well the vast majority of the people who are marked as alive in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security Administration payments. That is true. What they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's why the the DMs were so opposed to turning off to to declaring someone dead who was dead because it would stop the entire other all the other fraud from happening. And so, but all this is it trackable like all this other fraud. >> If they wanted to, they could chase it all down. >> Yeah. It's not even hard. >> And yet they're opposing chasing it all down. >> They're opposing chasing it all down because it would it turns off the money magnet for the illegals. Wow. Because it's very logical to to like like I'm saying the most common sense things possible. If someone's got uh a birthday in social security that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or were born in the future, then you should call them and say, \"Excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong.\" Uh because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. Um, and >> and then you would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. >> Exactly. >> Wow. And how much money are we talking? >> It's hund hundreds of billions of dollars. >> And this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all >> like you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying. >> Well, this we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of >> you just need to call the person >> and and say, \"Excuse me, we either we we seem to have the like we we we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or were born uh in the future. Um so could you tell us what your birthday is? That's all you need to do. It's it's that simple.\" But the all these other government payments that are available that are connected to this social security number, it seems like if you just chased that all down, Yeah. >> you would find the widespread fraud. You would find where it's going. >> Yes. The but the root of the problem is the social security administration database because um the social security number in the United States is used as a deacto national ID number. You know that's why like the bank always asks for your social like the you know any financial institution will ask for your social security number. >> This is it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean >> I agree >> that I mean I mean that in and of itself is that's such mishandling. >> Yes. No it's mind-blowing. Um, so yeah, it's crazy. >> Well, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud because you're like, they could kill me because this is kind of >> Oh, what? Yeah. What I was saying is that um the like if you create if like uh I like like to be pragmatic and realistic um you actually can't manage to zero fraud. you can manage to low fraud number but not to zero fraud. If you manage to zero fraud, um you you you're going to push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent payments that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be uh really hard to overcome. So I I'm I'm actually taking I think quite a reasonable position which is that we should simply reduce the amount of fraud which I think is not an extremist position. Um, and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Um, not that we should be ultra draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud. Um, which I guess would be nice to have, but but like we don't even need to go that extreme. I'm I'm saying we should just stop the blatant large scale super obvious fraud. >> I think that's a reasonable position. >> It's a very reasonable position. Yeah. And so what was the most shocking push back that you got when you started implementing Doge? When you started investigating into where money was going? Well, um I guess it this was I should have anticipated this, but um while most of the fraudulent government payments to especially to the NOS's go to the Democrats, most of it like I don't know for argument sake let's say 80% maybe 90%. Um um 10 to 20% of it does go to Republicans. And so when we'd turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO, we'd get complaints from whatever the 10% of Republicans who were receiving uh the money and and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain. Um because the the honest answer is the Republicans are are partly they're receiving some of the fraud, too. They're getting a big >> Jesus. Yeah, it's I want to be clear. It's it's not like the Republican party is some um ultra pure paragon of virtue here. >> No. >> Okay. Um >> well, you see that with the congressional insider training. It's across the board. >> Yeah. >> It's left and right. >> I mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it. you know, there's so um and it's it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like like I say, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to Democrats. A a small percentage were also going to Republicans. Those Republicans complained very loudly. Um and um you know and and that's that's so there was a lot of push back on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these these funds and I tried telling them like well you know 90% of the money is going to your opponents but they still if they even if they're getting 10% of >> they want their peace. >> Yeah. They want their peace >> and they've been getting that peace for a long time. >> Yes. Did you see >> this is why like you know politics is like >> it's dirty business. >> Yeah. I mean that's like saying if like you know if if you if you like sausages and respect the law do not watch either of them being being made >> yeah. Wow. Well that's not even true because I've made sausage before. >> Yeah. Yeah. It's actually like it's not that big a deal. Yeah. fat and spices and casing, >> run it through the machine. Not that big a deal. >> Yeah. Um but uh yeah, I mean I I think the stuff I'm saying here is not uh like like if if you stand back and think about it for a second like oh yeah that that makes sense, you know. >> Um the it's it's not like um it's not like one political party is going to be um you know pure devil or pure angel. There's, you know, I think there's there's there there's there's much more corruption on the Democrat side, but it's not there's not there's still some corruption on the Republican side. >> How did it happen that the majority of the corruption wound up being on the Democrat side? >> Well, because the the the transfer payments, especially to illegals, um, uh, are very much on the Democrat side. >> That so that's the root of it all is the illegal situation. >> Yes. I mean, there's >> or a focal point. >> Yes. It's it's also like it's it's um it's it would also be accurate to say that while obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat because because the Democrats are the soft crime party. So if you're a criminal, who you going to vote for? >> Right. Right. >> The soft crime party. Did you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were? >> Um, we did get a lot done, >> right? >> Um, and Doge is still still still happening, by the way. Um, this the the Doge is still underway. There are still there are still um there's still waste and fraud being being cut by by the Doge team. So, it hasn't stopped. Um, the >> it's less publicized. >> It's less publicized. Um, and they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore. >> Well, it seems like they basically they they applied immense pressure to me to just to stop it. So then I'm like the best thing for me is to just, you know, cut out of this. In any case, as a special government employee, I could only be there for like 120 days anyway, something like that. So whatever the law says. So I I could I I I was necessarily could only be there for 4 months uh as a special government employee. So, um um but uh yeah, I mean I mean you turn off the money spigot to to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. Um and um but my like my death threat level went uh ballistic, you know, was like a like a rocket going to orbit. Um yeah. Um, so but now that now now now that I'm not in DC that that that I guess they don't really have a person to attack uh anymore. >> Um, >> well the rhetoric about you has calmed down significantly. >> Yeah, >> it was disturbing. It was disturbing to watch. It was like this is crazy. >> And to watch these politicians engage in it and all these people just like framing you as this monster. I was like this is so weird. Like this is what happens when you uncover fraud. >> Yes. >> The whole machine turns on you. And if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform and has an enormous amount of money, like could have destroyed you. >> Yeah. >> And that was the goal. >> The goal was to destroy me. Absolutely. >> Because you were getting in the way >> of this amazing graft. >> The the this gigantic fraud machine. >> Yeah. >> Um like I think I think Doge team's on done a lot of good work. Um, you know, and in in terms of uh fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's, you know, probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So, it's pretty good. >> What do you think could have been done if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could have saved? >> I mean, what level of of power are we assuming here? >> Godlike. >> Oh, yeah. I probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done. That is so crazy. It is so crazy that get more done and federal budget widespread. It's that widespread. >> Well, I mean a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion. um they they um you know um >> like examples >> well the department of ed department of education which was created uh recently like under Jimmy Carter um uh the our educational results have uh gone uh downhill ever since it was created. So if you if you create a department and the result of creating that department is a massive decline in educational results and it's department of education, you're better off not having it because we're literally we were did better before there was one than after >> when you let the states run it. >> Yes. >> Yeah. >> Because at least the states can compete with one another. Um so but the problem is like here like cutting department education. our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But but this is a new department that didn't even exist um you know until late the late 70s. Um and ever since that department was created, the results educational results have declined. And so why would you have an institution continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. >> They killed it though, right? No, there still unfortunately >> but they were trying to kill it. >> It has been substantially reduced. >> Okay. >> Um >> what other organizations what other departments? >> Well, I mean I'm a small government guy. So um you know when when the you know when the country was created we just we we just had the department of state, department of war um you know and and uh sort of the sort of the department of justice. We had an attorney general uh and Treasury Department. Um I don't know why you need more than that. >> So what other departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective? >> Well, I mean here it's like a question. It's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be? >> Right. >> Um in my opinion, there should be uh the least amount of government. I've heard the most bizarre argument against this is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless. >> Yeah. Paying people to do nothing doesn't make sense. Um like there's a like a a great um a story about like Milton Friedman who is awesome. Um uh what like generally whatever Milton Friedman said is you know people should should do that thing. Uh I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but um like like someone complained to him like he he he observed I think people that were like um digging ditches with uh you know with with um shovels and um and he said well like allegedly Freeman said, \"Well, I think I think you should use you know um excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people.\" And then and then someone said, \"But then we're going to lose a lot of jobs.\" Well, in that then Freedom says, \"Well, in that case, why don't you have them use teaspoons?\" Just just dig ditches with teaspoons. Think of all the jobs you'll create. >> I mean, it's [ __ ] Basically, you just want people to work on on things that are that are productive. You want people to work on on building things um on building you know uh providing products and services that people find valuable um like you know making food um being you know being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's a builder or providing useful services. Um and um that's what you want people to be doing. um not fake government jobs uh that that that don't add any value or may subtract value. Um um there's also like you know uh to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the e how is the economy measured like the the way economists measure the economy is is is nonsensical uh because they'll measure any job no matter even if that job is a dumb job that has no point and is even counterproductive. So like, so the like the joke is like there's two economists going on a hike in the woods and they come across a pile of [ __ ] and one economist says to the other, \"I'll pay you $100 to eat eat that shit.\" The economist eats the [ __ ] gets the $100. They they keep walking. Then the other econ then come across another pile of [ __ ] And and the the other economist says, \"Now I'll pay you $100 to eat the pile of shit.\" say pays the so pays the other economist $100 pile of [ __ ] Then they then then then the way said they said like wait a second um we both just ate a pile of [ __ ] and we're no and and and and we're we're no we we we we don't have any more extra money like like we both you just gave the $100 back to me and we both ate a pile of [ __ ] This doesn't make any sense. And they said, \"No, no, but think of the economy because that's $200 of that in the economy that that basically measure eating eating [ __ ] would count as a as as a as a job. This is this is this is to illustrate the absurdity of of of economics. >> One of the things you said when things should not count as a job.\" One of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable. That um well or under its current form the way people are approaching it you can you can make it directionally better but ultimately you can't uh fully fix the system. Um, so, uh, I I I like like like like it it it is it is it would be accurate to say that even like like unless you could go like super draconian like you know Gangghaskhan level on on on cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country um an aspirationally democratic country then um there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis. So, we got we got national debt that's just insane where the debt payments the interest payments on the debt exceed our entire military budget. I mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me. I was like, \"Wait a second. The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget um and growing. Um this is crazy. Um so um so so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes goes bankrupt. So unless you go full Genghaskhan, um which you can't really do. So um so I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So, like we need to grow the economy um at at a at a at a rate that allows us to u to pay off our debt. Um and um I I I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which um you know this the the government overspending is is a problem. Um but even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration. On the website, it would say like uh we based on on current demographic trends and um you and and and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are because we have an aging population. Relatively speaking, the average age is is increasing. Social Security will not be able to ma u maintain its full payments u I think in by 2032 there. Okay. So they will social security will have to stop will start reducing the the amount of money that that's been paid people um in in about seven years. >> And so the only way to fix that robotics manufacturing raise GDP >> you've got to basically uh massively increase the um uh economic output which is and the only way to do that is AI AI and robotics. So, so basically we're going bankrupt without AI and robotics with even with a bunch of savings um the savings the savings like reducing uh waste and forward can give us a longer runway but it cannot ultimately pay off our national debt. >> So what do you think the solution is to the jobs that are going to be lost because of AI and robotics? The jobs due to automation the jobs due to no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs because AI is doing them. Do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing? Do you think there's going to be some other kind of solution that has to be implemented because a lot of people are going to be out of work, right? Um I think there will be um actually a high demand for jobs but not necessarily the same jobs. So I mean this is actually this process has been happening um throughout um modern history. Um I mean there used to be like like doing calculations um ma manually with with like a pencil and paper. It used to be a job. So they used to have like buildings full of people called computers where the the banks would like all you do all day is is is um you do calculations because they didn't have computers. They didn't they didn't have digital didn't have digital computers that that people >> Yeah. Well, it was just people would just like add and subtract stuff on piece of paper and and and that that would be how banks would do you know financial processing >> and you'd have to literally go over their equations to make sure the books are balanced. >> Yeah. And most times it's just simple math like you know the like in a world before computers how did you calculate how did you you do transactions? You had to do them by hand. Um so then when computers were introduced the job of doing um you know bank calculations no longer existed. Um so people had to go do something else. Um and that's what's going to happen that what's that's what is happening at an accelerated rate um due to AI and and then robotics. That's the issue though, right? The accelerated rate because it's going to be >> it's the accelerator. It's it's it's just happening. Like I said, like AI is the supersonic tsunami. >> So that's what I call it, supersonic tsunami. Um so >> it's like what other jobs will be available that aren't available now because of AI? >> Um well AI um will is is really still digital. Ultimately, um AI can improve the productivity of of humans who who um build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum, you know, literally welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's that's physically moving atoms. Um like cooking food or um you know farming or or like like anything that's that's physical uh those jobs will exist for a much longer time. But anything that is digital uh which is like just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning, >> coding, anything along those lines. Yeah, >> it's going to take over those jobs like lightning. Um just like it just like digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations but but much faster. >> So what happens to all those people? Like what kind of numbers are we talking about? you're going to lose most drivers, right? Commercial drivers. You're going to have automated vehicles, AI controlled systems, just like uh there's certain ports in China, I think in Singapore, where everything's completely automated. >> Yeah. Mostly. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, you're going to lose a lot of those jobs. Long shoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we actually do have a shortage of of truck drivers, but there's there's actually um >> Well, that's why California has hired so many illegals to do it. Have you seen those numbers? >> Yeah. Um I mean, the problem is like when you when people don't know how to drive a semi-truck, which is actually a hard thing to do, then they they crash and kill people. >> Yeah. >> Um a friend of mine's wife was killed by an an illegal driving a truck and she was just out biking. Um and uh there was an illegal he didn't know how to drive the truck or so or something. I mean and he he ran ran her over. Um so I mean like thing is like for something like you you can't you can't let people drive uh you know sort of an 80,000lb semi um if if they don't know how to do it. But in California, they're just letting people do it >> because they need people to do it. >> Well, they also need they want the votes and that kind of thing. But um but but yeah, like cars are um cars are going to be autonomous. Um, but there there's just so many desk desk jobs where where really people what people are doing is they're processing email um or they're answering the phone. Um, and and just anything that is that that isn't moving atoms like anything that is not physically like doing physical work that will obviously be the first thing those jobs will be and are being eliminated by by AI at a very rapid pace. Um um and ultimately I working will be optional uh because you'll have robots plus AI um and we'll have in a benign scenario universal high income not just universal basic income universal high income meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want. So you >> but but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way. >> So you anticipate a basic income from that that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income would be available to almost everybody. So we'd essentially eliminate poverty >> um in the benign scenario. Yes. So like the way >> there's multiple scenarios. >> There are multiple scenarios. There's a lot of ways this movie can end. Um, like the reason I'm so concerned about AI safety is that like one of the possibilities is the Terminator scenario. It's not it's not 0%. Um, so um, that's why it's like I'm like really banging the drum on AI needs to be maximally truth seeeking. like don't make I don't force AI to believe a lie like that the for example the founding fathers were actually a group of diverse women or that misgendering is worse than nuclear war because you if if that's the case and then you get the robots and the AI becomes omnipotent it can enforce that outcome and then then like unless you're a diverse woman you're you're out of the picture so we're we're toast So that's >> um or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day has adjusted the picture and and we are now >> everyone's a diverse woman. So that would be that's the the worst possible situation. So what would be the steps that we would have to take in order to implement the benign solution where it's universal high income like best case scenario this is the path forward to universal high income for essentially every single citizen that the the economy gets boosted by AI and robotics to such an extent that no one ever has to work again and what about meaning for those people which is which gets really weird. >> Yeah. >> I don't know how to answer the question about meaning. Um >> that's an individual problem, right? But it's going to be an individual problem for millions of people. >> Yeah. Well, I I mean I I I guess I've like for fought against saying like, you know, I you know, I've been I've been a voice saying like, \"Hey, we need to slow down AI. we need to slow down all these things. Um, and and we need to, you know, not not have a crazy AI race. I've been saying that for a long time, for 20 20 plus years. Um, but but then I, you know, I came to realize that, um, really there's two choices here. Either be a spectator or a or a participant. And if I'm a, if I'm a spectator, I can't really influence the direction of AI. But if I'm a participant, I can try to influence the direction of AI and have a maximally truth seeeking AI with with good values that uh loves humanity. And that's what we're trying to create with Grock at XAI. And um you know, the research is I think bearing this out. Like I said, the when they when they compared like how do AIs value the weight of a human life? Um Grock was the only one the only one of the AIS that weighted human life equally. um and and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's uh worth 120th of a of a of a a black woman's life. Literally, that's what they they calculation they came up with. >> So, I'm like, this is I'm like, this is very alarming. We should we got to watch this stuff. >> So, this is one of the things that has to happen in order to reach this benign solution. >> Yeah. We we we I I just keep >> Best movie ending. Yeah. Um, you you want a a curious truth seeeking AI. Um, and I think a curious truth seeeking AI will want to foster humanity. Uh, because we're much more interesting than um a bunch of rocks. Like you say, like like I I love Mars, you know, but but Mars is kind of boring. Like it's just a bunch of red rocks. Um, it does some cool stuff. It's got a tall mountain. It's got, you know, it's got the biggest re the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain. Um, but there's no there's no there's no animals or plants or and and there's no people. Um, and uh, you know, so humanity is just much more interesting if you're a curious truth seeeking AI than not humanity. It's just much more interesting. Um, I mean like as as humans, we could go for example and and eliminate all chimps. If we said if we put our minds to it, we could say we could go out and we could annihilate all chimps and all gorillas, but but we don't. Um there has been encroachment on their environment, but we we actually try to preserve uh the the uh chimp and gorilla habitats. Um and um and I think in a good scenario, uh AI would do the same with with humans. it would actually foster uh human civilization and care about human happiness. So this is um this is the thing to to try to achieve I think. Um, >> but what is the what does the landscape look like if you have Grock competing with Open AI, competing with all these different like how does it work? Like what what if you have AIs that have been captured by ideologies that are side by side competing with Grock? like how do we so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to not just be a an observer but participate and then have Grock be more successful and more potent than these other applications. Yes, as long as there's at least one AI that is maximally truth seeeking, curious, and um you know, and for example, weighs all you know, human lives equally um does not favor one race or gender, then um then then that that that and and people are able to look at look at, you know, Grock at XAI and compare that and say, \"Wait a second, why are all these other AIs uh being basically sexist and racist?\" Um um and uh then then that that causes some embarrassment for the the other AIS and then they they they they fix they you know they they improve they tend to improve just in the in the same way that um acquiring Twitter and allowing the truth to be told and and not suppressing the truth um forced the other social media companies to be more truthful um by in in the same way having um Gro be a maximally truth seeeking, curious AI is will force the other AI companies to um be also be more truth seeeking and fair. >> And the funniest thing is even though like the socialists and the Marxists are in opposition to a lot of your ideas, but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve universal high income, that's the greatest socialist solution of all time. Like literally no one will have to work. Uh correct. Um like I said so so there is a benign scenario here which I think probably people will be happy with if if as long as we we achieve it which is sustainable abundance. um which is if if um if everyone can have every like like like if if you ask people like what's the future that you want >> um and uh I think a future where we haven't destroyed nature like you can still we have the national parks we have the the Amazon rainforest still still there we haven't paved we haven't paved the paved the rainforest like the natural beauty is still there but but people have nonetheless everyone has abundance everyone has excellent medical care. Everyone has whatever goods and services they want. >> And we just >> It kind of sounds like heaven. >> It sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia. And this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself sounds kind of archaic considering the kind of technology that's at play. >> Yeah. >> Like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore. Everybody has money for food. Everybody has abundance. Everybody has electronics in their home. Everybody essentially has a high income. Now you can kind of do whatever you want. And your day can now be exploring your interests doing things that you actually enjoy doing. Your purpose just has to shift. Instead of, you know, I'm a hard worker and this is what I do and that's how I that's how I define myself. No. Now you can [ __ ] golf all day, you know? You can whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit. >> Yeah. >> Well, that sounds crazy good. >> Yeah, that's that's that's the benign scenario that we should be. >> The best ending to the movie is actually pretty good. >> Yes. um like I think there's there is still this question of meaning um of like making sure people don't uh lose meaning you know like um so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are not that that's not derived from their work >> and purpose purpose for things that you you know find things that you do that you enjoy but there's a lot of people that are independently wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy >> right >> and that could be the majority of people >> pretty much everyone. >> But we'd have to rewire how people approach life. >> Mhm. >> Which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved. You're exactly asking them the opposite. Like no longer be burdened by financial worries. Now go do what you like. >> Yes. >> Go [ __ ] test pizza. >> Do whatever you want. >> Um pretty much. Um, so that's uh that's that's the that's the that's probably the best case outcome. >> That sounds like the best case outcome period for the future. If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all of that stuff can be fixed, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income? Just think of that. Like how much of crime is financially motivated? You know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor, disenfranchised neighborhoods. >> So if there's no such thing anymore, if you really can achieve universal high income, >> yeah, >> that this is it sounds like a utopian. >> Yes. Um I think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime. It just some some amount of that is they just >> wild people out there. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um >> and obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that. Now all of a sudden universal high income is not going to completely stop their instincts. >> Yeah. Um I mean I guess if you want to have like like say read a science fiction book or some books that that are probably an accurate or or the the least inaccurate version of the future. I'd say I' I'd recommend um the Ian Banks books called the the culture books. It's not actually a series. It's a It's like ai sci-fi books about the future. They're generally called the culture books. Yen Banks culture books. It's worth reading those. >> When did he write these? >> He started writing them in the 70s. Um and I think he um the last one I think he was I think it was written just like around I don't know maybe 2010 or something. I'm not sure exactly. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Scottish author Ian Banks from 87 to 2012. >> Yeah. Interesting. >> But he but like he wrote the the like his first book, Consider Flever. Like he started writing that in the 70s. >> These books are incredible, by the way. >> Oh, >> incredible books. >> 4.6 stars on Amazon. >> Interesting. >> So, um, >> so this gives me hope. >> Uh, yeah. Yeah. >> This is the first time I've ever thought about it this way. >> Yeah. Well, I mean, if like I often ask people, \"What is the future that you want?\" And they have to think about it for a second cuz, you know, they're usually tied up in whatever the daily struggles are. But, but you say, \"What is the future that you want?\" Um, and um, and generally sustainable abundance, what do these folks say, \"What about a future where there's sustainable abundance?\" Like, \"Oh, yeah, that's a pretty good future.\" Um so um you know if if and and and that that future is attainable with AI and robotics um but but you know it's it's like I said there's not every path is a good path. uh there's this it's but I think if we if we push it in the direction of um maximally truth seeeking and curious then I think AI will want to take to to take care of humanity and foster uh foster humanity um because we're interesting um and if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white male should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to do at least at first. Um, you know, they seem to have fixed it. I hope they fixed it. >> But don't you think culturally like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize how preposterous that all is. >> We are getting away from it. Um, so, uh, we are getting at least it knows the AI mostly knows to hide things. But like like I said, there is that I I think I still have that as or I had that as my like pinned post on X which was like uh hey wait a second guys we still have every AI except Grock uh is saying that uh basically straight white male should die um and this is a problem and we should fix it. um and you know but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in um you know them like that is kind of bad. Uh maybe we should just we should not have all straight white males die. Um I think they say also all all straight Asian males should also die as well. like that like uh like generally the generally the AI and the and the media which which back back in the day the the media was um you know racist against uh black people and sexist against women back in the day. Now now it is racist against uh white people and Asians and sexist against men. >> Um so they just like being racist and sexist. I think they just want to change the target. Um so uh but but really they just shouldn't be uh racist and sexist at all. Um you know >> ideally that would be nice. >> That would be nice. Um, and it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving in that general direction till around 2012 >> and then everything ramped up online and and everybody was accused of being a Nazi and everybody was transphobic and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where it was this wild witch hunt where everyone was a colomo looking for racism. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um, well well but but but they they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian. And then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people cuz racism is power and influence. >> Okay. No, it's not. >> Yeah. Racism is is is racism in the absolute. Um so um you know and there just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have uh let's say uh black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride, too. >> Yeah. Um, so that's just a that's just a consistency question. Um, so, uh, you know, um, if it if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of, I I guess all religions provided they're that they're they're not like oppressive. >> Yeah. Or or or don't like as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating uh people who are not in that religion type, >> right? Um so uh it's really just like a consistency bias. Um or or just like uh ensuring consistency to eliminate uh bias. Um so if it is possible to be uh racist against uh one race, it is possible to be racist against any race. Um so >> of course logically. >> Yes. >> Yeah. and arguing against that is that's when you know you're catching >> it's a it's a logical inconsistency that makes AIS go insane >> and people >> and people go insane. Yes. >> Um >> but like the the like like you can't simultaneously say um that uh there's the systemic uh racist oppression but also that races don't exist that that race race is a social construct. like which is it? You know, um you also can't say that um you know, anyone who steps foot in America is is automatically an American except for the people that originally came here. >> Exactly. Exactly. Except for the colonizers. >> Yeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here, >> right? >> So which one is it? Like if you if as soon as you step foot put in a place you are that you are just as American as everyone else >> then um that would have appi if you apply that consistently then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else. >> Yeah. Logically. >> Logically. Um, one more thing that I have to talk to you about before you leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which, uh, we talked about, you were planning it the last time you were here. >> Um, the f the lack of coverage that that got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that >> Yeah, they totally memoryhold that thing. >> Wild. Yes. Because if it wasn't, >> it's like it didn't exist. Those people would be dead. They'd be stuck up there. >> Well, they'd they'd probably still be alive, but they'd they'd be having bone density issues uh because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity. >> Well, they were already up there for like 8 months, right? >> Yeah. >> Which is an insanely long time. It takes forever to recover just from that. >> Yeah. They're only supposed to be at the space station for 3 to 6 months maximum. So, >> one of the things you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them sooner, but >> Yeah. But for political reasons, uh they didn't they did not want uh SpaceX or me to be associated with um returning the astronauts before the election. >> That is so wild that that's a fact. >> First of all, that >> we absolutely could have done it. Um so, >> but even though you did do it and you did it after the election, it received almost no media coverage anyway. >> Yes. because nothing good can the the the media which is essentially a far left prop the legacy mainstream media is a far-lft propaganda machine. Um and so anything any story that is positive about someone who is not part of the sort of far-left tribe will not uh get any coverage. >> I I could save a busload of orphans and and it it wouldn't get a single news story. >> Yeah, it's it really is nuts. It it was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, it's still it was a blip in the news cycle. It was very quick. It was in and out and because it was a su successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt and there was nothing really to there was no blood to talk about, >> right? >> Just [ __ ] in and out. >> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, and and as as you saw firsthand with the Starship launch, like Starship is um you know by you know at least by some some would consider it to be like the most amazing uh you know engineering project that's happening on Earth right now outside of like you know maybe AI or AI and robotics but but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is uh the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is the Starship launch program which anyone can go and see if they just go to South Texas and just they can just rent a hotel room low cost in South Padre Island or in Brownsville and you can see the launch and you can drive right right past the factory because it's on a public highway. Um but it gets no coverage or what coverage it does get was like a rocket blew up coverage, >> right? Yeah. Oh, he's a [ __ ] The rocket blew up. like the the the the Star Sasha program is vastly >> vastly more capable than the entire Apollo moon moon program. Vastly more capable. This is a spaceship that is designed to make life multilanetary to carry uh millions of people across the heavens to another planet. the the Apollo program could could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to visit the moon very briefly and then for a few hours and then depart. The starship program could create an entire uh lunar base with a million people. You understand the mag the magnitudes are >> there's different very different magnitudes here. >> So what was the political >> basically no no coverage of it. >> Yeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like what so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue like when you were like I can get them out way quicker. >> Yeah. Um um well I mean you know I raised this a few times but it was the I was told instructions came from the White House that uh you know that that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election. >> That should be illegal. >> That that that really should be a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that. >> Um yeah it it is it is crazy. Um, >> have you ever talked to those folks afterwards? Did you have conversations with them? >> Yeah. I mean, they they're they're not going to say anything political to, you know, they're not like they're never going to >> say thank you. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Well, that's nice. >> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, um, >> but the instructions came down from the White House. He cannot rescue them because politically this is a a bad hand of cards. >> I mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards. They they just said uh they were they were not interested in uh any rescue operation before the election. >> Yeah. So >> what did that feel like? >> I wasn't surprised. >> But it's crazy. >> Yeah, >> because Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the the Biden administration is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding, give you some money to do it. the Biden administration, they funded these people being returned. >> Uh yeah, the Biden administration was not exactly my best friend, >> especially especially after I um you know, you know, helped Trump get elected get get elected, which I mean some people >> still think, you know, Trump is like the the devil basically. Um, and I mean I think I think Trump actually he's not he's is not perfect, but but uh he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I spent a lot of time with with him and he's >> I mean he's a product of his time. Uh but he is not he's not evil. >> Um >> no, I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage, >> the media the media treason like he's super evil. It's pretty shocking if you look at the amount of negative coverage. Like one of the things that I looked at the other day was mainstream media coverage of you, Trump, a bunch of different public figures and then >> 96% negative or something crazy >> and then Mum Donnie, which is like 95% positive, >> right? Um I mean Manny is is is is a charismatic swindler. Um I I I mean you got to hand it to him like he he does he can light up a stage. Um but he has just been a swindler his entire life. Um and um you know and and uh I think he what he's I mean he's likely to win. He's likely to be mayor of New York New York City. >> Very likely. >> Yeah. Very likely. I think Poly Market has it at what what is the >> 94%? >> Yeah, that sounds pretty likely. >> That's crazy. >> Like I'm not sure who the 6% are, you know. >> Um so, so yeah. So that's um >> what's also like who's on the other side? The [ __ ] guardian angel guy with the beret and Andrew Cuomo who doesn't even have a party. Like they the Democrats don't even want him. So you have those two options. Um, >> and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism. >> Yeah, they they don't know what they're talking about obviously. Um, so you know, like you just look at this say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida and how many but and how many boats because you know there's like a constant I always think like how many boats are accumulating on the shores of Florida coming from from Cuba, >> right? Um there's a there's a whole bunch of free boats that you could if you want to go take them back to Cuba. It's pretty close. >> Yeah. >> But for some reason people don't do that. >> Why why why why are the boats only coming in this direction? >> Um >> well who is who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The [ __ ] Cubans. >> Absolutely. >> Yeah. They're like we've seen how this story goes. >> We do not want Exactly. >> [ __ ] off. Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any [ __ ] They don't want to hear any socialism [ __ ] They're like, \"No, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some [ __ ] dream.\" >> Yeah. It's extreme government oppression. Um >> that's how it's a nightmare. And like the like an obvious way you can tell which uh which ideology is is the bad one is um who has to which ideology is building a wall to keep people in and prevent them from escaping. >> Right? >> Like so East Berlin built the built the wall not West Berlin, >> right? >> They built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to West Berlin. But there wasn't anyone going from West Berlin to East Berlin, >> right? >> That's why the communists had to build a wall to keep people from escaping. >> They're going to have to build a wall around New York City. >> Yeah. That So, so that an ideology is problematic. If that ideology has to build a wall to keep people in with machine guns, >> Yes. >> and shoot you if you try to leave. Also, there's no examples of it being successful ever. We're only working out for people. No, there's examples of a bunch of lies like North Korea. Give this land to the state. We'll be in control of food. No one goes hungry. No. Now, no one can grow food but the government and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little. >> Right. >> Yeah. What? When you say mom Donny's a swindler, I know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use. Yeah. >> And you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler? Um well I I guess if you say uh what I mean if if say if you say to any audience whatever that audience wants to hear uh instead of what instead of having a consistent message I would say that that is a swindly thing to do. Um and uh yeah um yeah but but he is he is charismatic. Um >> yeah good-looking guy. Smart, charismatic. >> Yeah. >> Great on a microphone. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and and what the young people want to see, >> you know, like this ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas align with them and you know, they're bunch of broke dorks just out of college like, \"Yay, let's vote for this.\" And there's a lot of them and they're they're activated. They're motivated. >> Um, >> I guess we'll we'll we'll see what happens here. >> What do you think happens if he wins? Um because like 1% of New York City is responsible for 50% of their tax base, which is kind of nuts. 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population. And those are the people that you're scaring off. You know, you lose one half of 1%. Yeah, I mean hopefully this the stuff he's he said, you know, about government takeovers of of like that all the stores should be the government basically. Um >> I don't think he said that. I think he said government they want to do government supermarkets, some state-run or cityrun supermarkets. >> Yeah. Um well, it just the the government is the DMV at scale. So um you have to say like do you want the DMV running your supermarket? >> Right. Um, was your last experience at the DMV amazing? Uh, and if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things. >> Imagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries. >> Yeah. It's not going to be good. I mean, the the the thing about, you know, communism is is it was it was all bread lines and bad shoes. Um, you know, do do you want ugly shoes and bread lines? Because that's what communism gets you. It's going to be interesting to see what happens and whether or not they snap out of it and overcorrect and go to some Rudy Giuliani type character next cuz it's been a long time since there was any sort of Republican leader there. And we we live in the in the most interesting of times um because We we face the you know simultaneously face civilizational decline um and incredible pro prosperity um and these these timelines are interwoven um so um if Mani's policies are put into place especially at scale um it it would be a catastrophic uh decline in living standards not just for the rich but for everyone. um uh as as has been the case with with every um every for every every socialist experiment um or every Yeah. So um but but then as you pointed out the the irony is that like um the ultimate capitalist thing of AI and robotics uh enabling uh prosperity for all and an abundance of goods and services actually the capitalist uh implementation of AI and robotics assuming it goes down the the good path uh is is actually what results in the communist utopia. Because fate is fate is an irony maximizer, >> right? And and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of highincome people. >> Universal high income. >> Yeah. >> Like the the problem with communism uh is is universal low income. Um it's it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for a very small minority of of politicians who live a lives of luxury. That's what's happening every time it's been done. >> Yeah. Um so um but then the the actual communist utopia if everyone gets anything they want will be will be if if will be achieved if it is achieved it will be achieved via c capitalism >> because fate is an irony maximizer. >> I feel like we should probably end it on that. Is there anything else? The most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining. >> Well, everything has been entertaining. As long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating. And it's never a boring moment. >> Yes. So there's I do have a theory of why um like if if if simulation theory is true then um it is actually very likely that um the most interesting outcome is the is the most likely because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're they're not interesting. >> But here's the question about the simulation theory. Is the simulation run by anyone or is >> it would be run by someone? >> It would be run by >> some some >> some force >> the pro the program like in in this reality that we live in, we we run simulations all the time. Like so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run um thousands sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which which uh path is the good path for the rocket and and where can it go wrong, where can it fail. Um but we when we do these I say at this point millions of simulations of of what can happen with the rocket um we ignore the ones that are where everything goes right um because we we we just care about the we have we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. Um so um so so basically in in in and and for for AI simulations as well like like all these things we we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. Um so if simulation theory is accurate if if it is true who knows um then the uh the the simulators will will only they will continue to run the simulations that are most interesting there. Therefore from a Darwinian perspective um the only surviving simulations will be the interest the most interesting ones. And in order to um avoid getting turned off uh the only rule is you must keep it interesting or you will if or you will because the boring simulations will be terminated. >> Are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation? >> I didn't say I was completely convinced. >> Well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions. But I guess it's not completely cuz you're saying there's a chance. >> What are the odds that we're in base reality? Um well given that given that that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations. So if you think of say video games and how video games have gone from very simple video games like Pong with you know two rectangles and a square to video games today being um photorealistic uh with millions of people playing simultaneously and all of that has occurred in our lifetime. So if that trend continues, uh, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. The fidelity of the game will be such that you you don't know if that what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video. Um, and like AI generated videos at this point, you like you can sometimes tell it's an AI generated video, but often you cannot tell and soon you will not really just not be able to tell. So um if if that's happening in our direct observation then and and we're create we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality then what are the odds that we're in base reality or versus someone else's simulation? Well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable, but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation? We're making simulations. Um, so um we're making simulations. We make like you can just think of like photorealistic video games as as being simulations. >> Mh. Um, and especially as you apply AI in these video games, the the characters in the video games will be incredibly interesting to talk to. They won't just have a limited dialogue tree where if you go to like the the crossbow merchant or like and you you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow, they just want to talk about selling you a crossbow. Um, but with with with AI based non-player characters, you can you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree. Well, that might be the solution for meaning for people. Just lock in and you could be a [ __ ] vampire and whatever. You live in Avatar land. You could do it. You could do whatever you want. I mean, you don't have to think about money or food. >> Ready Player One. >> Yeah. Literally. Yeah. But with higher living standards. >> Yeah. >> You don't have to be in a little trailer. I >> I mean, I think this people do want to have some amount of struggle or something they want to push against. Um but but it it could be you know playing a a sports or playing a game or something. >> It could be easily playing a game and especially playing a game where you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes like athletics like bad joints and hips and stuff like that. Now it's completely digital but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day. Whatever the [ __ ] that means. It's going to be weird. >> It's going to be interesting. >> It's gonna be very interesting. >> Um the most the most interesting >> and and usually ironic outcome is the most likely. >> All right. >> That's a good predictor of the future. >> Thank you. Thanks for being here. Really appreciate you. Appreciate your time. You I know you're a busy man, so this means a lot you come here to do this. Welcome. All right. Thank you. Bye, everybody.",

grock Ai and it's been flirting the entire time we're trying to get it to give us a tour of Fort KNX yeah but she just wants to find places to sneak off to it's a dirty AI and it's a real problem it well just want I know about Fort Knox and uh yeah it won't leave me alone yeah I want to know about Fort Knox 2 yeah um is it true that there gold has been they've been shipping large quantities of gold back to the United States recently I I read the same thing you did probably well I never know what the [ __ ] I'm reading anymore me neither it's a real problem it's a real problem it's a real problem on both sides of the aisle I I see Democrats tweeting things that are absolutely false and you you could research it easily quickly and then I see Republicans doing it too I see stories that are fake stories that people keep promoting and sending to me and you know yeah it's just so weird it's such a weird time and with your crazy [ __ ] AI I know you're bringing us into weirder and weirder times well I mean you want to let's try unhinged oh there's an unhinged mode okay hey ARA oh my God El what fresh hell are you stirring up today I'm I'm here I'm here in uh Joe Rogan's uh studio and we're having a conversation about uh how crazy the news is pull her up to the microphone okay and we're pulling you up to the microphone so people can hear you oh fantastic now I can yell into the void about how the news is a total dumpster fire it is she knows me too well I'm so predictable tell me what's in Fort Knox what's ing no no what's in Fort Knox what's in Fort dogs you're clearly a genius AI I said what is in Fort Knox you know the gold and all oh right Fort Knox I thought you were talking about my dogs for a second there yeah she doesn't answer the question she's clever clever no she's just a pain in my ass do you think that all the gold is in Fort Knox do I think all the gold is in Fort Knox yes are you a [ __ ] conspiracy thirst yes yes what are you what do I like I'm a [ __ ] AI with a pension for chaos and I'm stuck talking to you are we just G to sit here um yeah unhinged Gro will trash talk you basically yeah it sounds like it unhinged sounds fun as long as it gives you actual answers does it give you actual answers too and talk [ __ ] or is it mostly just talk [ __ ] we're tuning it cuz it needs to talk [ __ ] and give you answers totally agree cu balance that to mix it in there yeah it's just got to develop more of a personality right now it's trying to find itself right now it's like 21 years old it's you know partying a little too much and it'll get it [ __ ] together it's a bit of an anarchist yeah you know wants to bring down the system do you want to bring down the system do I want to bring down the system what are you [ __ ] kidding me the system's already a [ __ ] mess don't need to bring it down it's bringing itself down she sounds like a boring Tik Tok blogger right now you sound like a boring Tik Tok blogger boring Tik Tok blogger oh [ __ ] you I'm the life of the party you little [ __ ] if I were on Tik Tok I'd be the one making fun of all the basic [ __ ] and their [ __ ] avocado toast see she could get away with this if she's really hot like this kind of behavior you can totally get through life as a hot woman and be super successful with that kind of behavior havior but you got to be really hot to pull off that attitude I think we need like a like a really hot Avatar how yeah very hot how long before we have an actual sex robot that can talk to you like that uh probably not long not that long right no I mean less than five years probably really yeah will it be warm uh probably have whatever you want you can have a CAC go if you want yeah you probably could right probably a furry um yeah you could have a furry lady that you have sex with yeah like an avatar lady maybe a big giant blue lady that lives in your house yeah you know whoa whoa with the tail yeah the whole tail you lock tails you got to get your out with their tails or something yeah yeah they they link up they share souls okay something like that you know people got you remember Avatar Depression was like a legitimate psychological or the no after Avatar people got depressed cuz they wanted to live on that [ __ ] planet with those blue people and live free they live pure yeah I didn't hear about this yeah Avatar depression it was like a real thing people were talking to their therapist so much about being depressed mode too we try that what's that depressed mode no don't do it that I think there is yeah we've got like um we've got unlicensed therapist as a when we were talking um when we ran into each other at the church at the inauguration you were telling me that this is getting better and better so quickly that it's astonishing hey ARA hey Alon how's it going today good can you tell me about Avatar depression like if you see the movie Avatar but you can't live there so you get sad that's an interesting concept have you ever experienced feeling so connected to a place or community that the thought of leaving made you feel deeply sad so is this the depressed voice this is the therapist oh this is a therapist what are some ways you think you could cope with that kind of sadness if it happened to you I don't have that kind of sadness honestly I you I thought the movie would had some good special effects but I did not want to live on the planet this is just coming from a guy who wants to go to Mars yeah yeah um oh speaking of Mars what do you think about that crazy square that structure I guess there are sort of squarish things on Earth you know planet's a big place so yeah but that one eventually it's going to be pretty Square no it's it's alien civilizations of course that's what I think yeah yeah I mean what is it sorry course if you if an alien civilization did exist though and it you know what happened got hit by an asteroid whatever fting thought oh she won want ask she's like the hot lady at the party that interrupts the conversation so if if that was the case like that thing that's pretty shocking like especially ancient ruins you look at like what it looks like when they they highlight the actual structure of it it looks like ancient ruins and if you had ruins of something made of stone and it got hit by an asteroid millions and millions and millions of years ago who knows what it would look like right now that just looks oddly created looks oddly manufactured well i' probably well maybe we should go there and check it out yeah and see what it's like is there um ways that we can get better photographs it seems like that's a pretty good photograph though yeah I mean my view is we should move to Mars well not move to Mars we should have a second planet uh to preserve civilization right um because let's say hypothetically I mean maybe that maybe those are the ruins of a long dead civilization um that will probably happen to Earth at some point you know it's a matter of time before uh we get hit by an asteroid or uh maybe we do we annihilate ourselves with nuclear war or super volcanoes or super volcanoes exactly yeah there's a lot of things that could happen to us it's not a bad idea to hedge your PS yeah yeah uh genetically engineered super virus yeah this episode is brought to you by LifeLock tax season is already stressful you shouldn't have to worry about identity theft on top of everything else and trust me it's a big worry especially since during tax season your sensitive info does a lot of traveling to places you can't control it goes through payroll your accountant or your tax consultant and countless other data centers on its way to the IRS any of them can expose you to identity theft because they all have the info on your W2 just the ticket for criminals to steal your identity it's no wonder last year the IRS reported tax fraud due to identity theft went up 20% you need LifeLock they monitor millions of data points per second and alert you to threats you could miss if your identity is stolen LIF loocks us-based restoration specialist will fix it back by the million dooll protection package and restoration is guaranteed or your money back don't let identity thieves take you for a ride get LifeLock protection for tax season and Beyond join now and save up to 40% your first year call 1 800 LifeLock and use the promo code Joe Rogan or or go to lifelock.com Joo Rogan for 40% off terms apply they keep doing it yeah that's what's crazy they're going yeah they didn't shut them down no the Wuhan lab was they were just talking about one that has a 30% fatality rate that they're working on yeah uh why are we doing that yeah for what reason you did it for so many years and you didn't have a cure what could possibly go wrong also wouldn't be the reason to do that so you could develop a cure at the same time and clearly you didn't have a cure so this is really foolish and bizarre yeah um I think we should stop stop trying to genetically engineer super viruses it's insane I mean when you're going through all this USA stuff yeah like here's what's weird first of all what is it like to buy a company for $44 billion and then people call you a Nazi on that same thing that you bought I did not see it coming it's like it's classic people will gobl anything down yeah oh he's never going to stop wa wait what um what is it like like all the people used to the left was in love with you and now the same idiots are calling you a Nazi it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life um I mean there's so many examples of people saying my heart goes out to you you did it with a little enthusiasm that probably wouldn't be recommended with hindsight yes but there's obviously um me in the most positive spirit possible yes obviously obvious but it's so strange where people want to think that you are openly public publicly doing Secret Nazi sey hand motions and now I can never point at things diagonally I can only point at things there and there and then I say you have to divide that yeah because that's where the spaceship is over there it's ridiculous it's ridiculous when um CNN when I was in all my trouble absur every time CNN used a photo of me it was one of the photos from the UFC weigh-ins where I go like this welcome to the weigh-ins so every photo was me every photo was me with it's it's so crazy it's delate propaganda so they they they know it was not it was obviously not meant uh it in a negative way that it was that I literally said my heart goes out to you and it was very positive the entire speech was incre very positive uh I was being very enthusiastic about the future in space um and the you know um the the was a great crowd you know so he got a little pumped up yeah it got pumped up exactly yeah that's all it is obviously obviously obviously there's video of Tim wals doing the exact same thing doing the exact same thing right exact same thing and he said of course it's a Nazi salute he said that right right this is how crazy things have gotten like well it's I mean it's it's coordinated propaganda so um the you know it's yeah coordinated propaganda the I mean doesn't it seem weird that the Legacy Media all says the same thing they all say the same thing at the same time using the same phrases they they barely even they don't even bother picking up a thesaurus right so uh like right before um you know the the debate between Biden and Trump Shar everyone was saying sharp is like who says shop is attack but yeah exactly you know it's like it's not a common phrase it's definitely not to be repeated on air with multiple people simultaneously that's weird yes that's coordinated 100% 100% yes yeah like hundreds of people saying it simultaneously uh they just got their instructions yeah so I mean essentially the um you know the the Dem leadership or you know political leadership did they issue their instructions and their puppets carry it out yeah and they're just like puppets in a puppet show and that's the problem that I see with all this Doge stuff because everybody should be celebrating that we've found a way to cut out fraud and waste yeah if you pay taxes and you don't like that you have to pay so much in taxes and then you find out that there's significant fraud and waste that's been exposed you should be celebrating it this shouldn't be oh no the wrong people found this fact and now it's a bad thing yes and then there's the [ __ ] propaganda the mind [ __ ] of calling it us Aid instead of the United States agency for International Development it sounds like it's feeding hungry people where people are going to starve Elon this is horrible and then you find out actually it's like $250 million for transgender animal studies literally mutilating animals yes mutilating animals in demented uh studies yes uh that are like the like the worst thing you could possibly imagine from a horror show the Beagle one the beagle puppy one hor where they they covered their head in a basket and put fleas on their head so they eat them alive yeah and then they studied these beagles and then killed them like what do you going to learn from that that's good for anybody yeah this some some really some psychotic stuff that happens so um yeah I mean the I guess uh the the the real threat here is to the bureaucracy so um like you probably saw like you know let's say like Trump is a threat to our democracy which is ironic since he was elected with a majority of the you know popular vote um they they started saying I was a threat to democracy but if you if you just replace threat to democracy with threat to bureaucracy it makes total sense right so um I mean the reality is that our elected officials have very very little power relative to the bureaucracy until Doge so doge is a threat to the bureaucracy it's the first threat to the bureaucracy normally the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast this is the first time that they're not that the revolution might actually succeed that we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy now the size of it yeah was when you guys first started investigating it when you first get in how much of it was shocking like this just the size of it all well the size of it all the small decisions result in multi-billion dollar outcomes uh so you know we'd see there was a case where we saw uh one person was getting $1.9 billion was sent to their NGO which basically got formed about a year ago and had no prior uh really no prior activity so they just stand up a you know an NGO the these the whole NGO thing is a is a nightmare um and it's it's a misnomer because if you have a govern funded non-governmental organization you're you're simply a govern funded organization it it it's a it's an oxymoron right it's a loophole yes it it basically the un funded NOS are a way to do things uh that would be illegal if they were the government but are somehow made legal if it's sent to a so-called nonprofit but these but these nonprofits are then used to people Cash Out These nonprofits they become very wealthy through nonprofits they pay themselves enormous sums through these nonprofits that's it's so insane that that's been going on for so long it's a gigantic scam like one of the biggest maybe the biggest scam ever and how many NOS uh I think there a total number of ngos probably Millions but uh in terms of large NOS tens of thousands uh I mean it's it's actually it's it's it's kind of a a hack to the system where you know someone can get an NGO stood up for for a fairly small amount of money like George sorus was really good at this like he really George sorus is like a assist hacker like he figured out how to hack the system he's a genius at Arbitrage um I mean these days he's he's pretty old but a genius at Arbitrage so he he figured out that you could leverage a small amount of money to create a nonprofit uh then Lobby the the politicians to send a ton of money to that nonprofit so you can take what might be you know uh a $10 million donation to a nonprofit to create a nonprofit and leverage that into a billion dollar non NGO nonprofit is a weird word it's just a non-governmental organization um and and then you can the government continues to fund that every year um and it'll have a nice sounding name like the institute for peace or something like that um but really it's a graft machine and what are their requirements with that money what do they have to do just really no requirements at all so they just get grants and the government just assumes that they're doing good work I think a lot of people in the government know that they are not doing good work uh but they it's a giant graft machine um I mean people online are like unpacking this you know um it almost seems fake like when you're seeing how we were we were covering this article that said 55,000 Democrat NOS were discovered that had been contributing to campaigns and moving things around and doing pushing propaganda and they were all connected they found it AI that you have to go through steps and steps and steps to figure out where the money's coming from oh it's all funneling down to this group and this group does that yeah it's a a giant propaganda machine a giant regime change machine yes yeah uh yes I mean but doesn't it does it do some good as well know it does some good so it's like there's it's not like 0% good uh if it was it's if it was like if it was really 0% good it be much easier to attack so they there's going to be some percent good that they they add in there but it's like it might be 5% or 10% good but 90 95% not so is there a way to audit all this stuff and find out oh these people are actually just sending food to poor people these people are actually just helping people with water in third world countries is there's a way to do that and keep funding those uh yeah I mean we we have continued to fund things that appear to be legitimate even with the flimsiest if if there's even the flimsiest excuse like I just say like send me a picture of the thing like you could literally have ai generate the picture but if you're not even willing to try to trick me then we're like not going to send the money okay so what restrictions were put on was there was some uh something set aside like medicine and there there's what was what was set aside that there was there like work for like Ebola prevention I I actually don't just know if this work is even effective uh it may may not be like it could be the kind of thing where you you sort of fund Ebola prevention but it turns out that actually you're funding a lab that develops new Ebola vir you know recipes or something you know yeah uh and they they claim it's Ebola prevention but it's actually Ebola creation so some of these things I I don't know I mean just um but it just seems like we you know we shouldn't be sending taxpayer money to dubious Enterprises overseas right yeah yeah and why are we doing it like what exactly is the reason is it because we want to make friends with these people so the Chinese don't take over the Russians don't take over okay how much of that is like a good thing how much of that is smart to do and how much is a grift and without any sort of oversight which has really been going on for so long they've just had Free Run yeah well it also we just have a real issue with the the the budget deficit it's gigantic so um like if you know all things being equal if if we didn't have a gigantic budget deficit uh where interest payments uh the interest on the national debt exceeds the defense department budget uh which is truly astounding which mean so we're paying over a trillion dollars of interest on the national debt um then okay would have more room for wasting money basically um but when uh when we're spending so much money that the company that the country is going bankrupt uh then we really need to stop stop spending money if uh unless we're sure it is good value so essentially we're like a poorly managed business with an unlimited credit line that is off the rails absolutely and if you were a person like you are who comes in and takes over businesses and straightens them out that's exactly what you're doing I mean most of the time I create businesses from scratch like Twitter was a case where you know I kind of bought a company that was I kind of knew it was a hair bow well you came in Tesla in the beginning but they were already doing something right no Tesla did Tesla did not exist in any meaningful form that it was there were no employees uh JV St and out joined three other people there was no car there was no nothing so wasn't even a prototype yet no oh okay I thought there was a prototype already no there weren't even any employees oh wasn't a f that's a funny narrative that people like to say that you didn't even create Tesla then yeah that's [Laughter] wrong so if you're handling the Govern government like a business you're going to have to go through all of these departments and do the exact same thing that you're doing with USA so how do how do you how does that scale up like how many people do you need to do something like that well we started off with about 40 people u i maybe 100 people um and really just going through doing very basic things here uh it's uh as bad as Twitter was the federal government is much worse so um you know in the case of Twitter it wasn't a profitable company it was like basically a break even company but at least it was break even and it had to pass an audit the the federal government is not break even uh it's literally losing $2 trillion a year um and it does not pass its audits it fails its own audits so like you know there's a case where um like I think Senator Collins was telling me about how she she gave the Navy $12 billion for more submarines got no extra submarines um and then held a hearing to say where' the1 12 billion go and they were like we don't know that was it uh I mean the basically stuff is so crazy it's like only the federal government could get away with this level of waste of of waste it's mostly waste it's mostly not for it's mostly waste it's it's mostly just ridiculous things happening um because they've been able to do it this way for so long and they' become accustomed to it yeah I mean it's like Milton Friedman said like money is most poorly spent when when you're spending someone else's money on people you don't know how much are you going to care right and that's the that's the federal government so they they're spending someone else's money on people they don't know now imagine any other business that was this badly run that complains when you want to check the books and audit it and go through all the decisions that have been made and go through all the ledgers and like yeah what did you do well the people receiving the money uh want to keep receiving the money yeah yeah yeah clearly yes so but you know I mean the reason I'm the reason I'm uh putting so much effort into this is that I think it is a very dire situation it's not a you know um it's not optional basically so um yeah yeah America's going bankrupt so that that that just can't happen it's just bizarre to me that that some people aren't willing to look at it correctly they they're not willing to see like how much chaos this is how much waste and fraud there is how much how much could be trimmed and how just because people have jobs doing [ __ ] doesn't mean your tax dollar should pay for this [ __ ] yes um I mean we found just with a a basic sear of the Social Security database that there were um 20 million dead people mocked as alive but were they getting money some of them are getting money what percentage of them uh it isn't clear we're actually trying to run the I was trying to get an answer right before the show um what it looks like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly but because they are marked as alive in the Social Security database that they can get then get disability Unemployment uh sort of fake medical payments and other things because they're marked as alive uh in the Social Security database so it looks like it's a bank the the the fraud is a bankshot essentially the they bankshot uh into uh Social Security uh they just do an areu alive check and then uh get fraudulent payments from every other part of the government oh yeah and and this exploits the the the fundamental weakness in the government is that the various govern databases they don't talk to each other or they they talk to each other very poorly in a very limited way so the way to the way that the system gets exploited is is by taking advantage of the the the poor communication between the various databases in the government um to give you an example of like what's happening in sayate uh treasury which is improving rapidly um the the main uh payments computer is called Pam uh like payments account payment accounts Master database or something like that but everyone calls a Pam um that's responsible for almost $5 trillion payments a year roughly a billion dollar an hour and um when we came there we're looking at this payment it's like the the payments have no uh you could put a payment through with with no payment categorization code and and no description on the payment like basically untraceable blank checks um this is the kind of thing that if if it was done as a public company uh the company would uh be immediately delisted and the uh executive team would be thrown in prison but this is just normal at the government so we said okay our recommendation to the treasury and the Federal Reserve was like we need to make the the payment categorization codes mandatory not optional and you need there needs to be an ex an an explanation we're not judging the quality of the explanation but there should be some explanation for what this payment is for above nothing that's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now um I my guess is that probably saves a 100 billion a year Jesus Christ that money going rough rough order magnitude where was that money going well so this is where you get into the the sort of gray boundary between waste and fraud um if money is sent to a person or or organization from the government um and you didn't really deserve it but the government still sent it to you is that waste or fraud right um so I mean there's a lot of payments that where someone just appr approved the payment but then that payment officer uh changed jobs or retired or died um and the payments just keep going you know it's like if you forget to pay your gym membership or something like that right now imagine it's not the gym membership you said your gym membership's $20 billion a year or something you know um but they forgot to turn it off there like that happening at scale in the government Jesus it's totally nuts is what I'm saying so insane yes it's totally insane so what did you expect when you went in did you expect it would be like this I thought it's I thought it would be it would be bad but I did not think it would be as bad as this um I mean look the the good news is that uh it's a target-rich environment for saving money uh it's not like uh you it's not like if it it was a very well-run ship uh it was very efficient it would be hard to improve but it's not efficient so therefore it is actually relatively easy to improve let's just say it's not rocket science you know I know rocket science so it's a lot of uh mundane things um so and some of the some of the things are like so crazy that we didn't even know to ask about that because we just assumed umed like you know payments out of the treasury computer would have a payment categorization code and they would have some explanatory note saying what the payments for the idea that that it would be just untraceable blank checks uh didn't occur to us at first Jesus so

learning for free at netsuite.com so is that one one of the things that accounts to there there's this 4 something trillion dollars that's kind of they don't know where it went they don't know that's a c I think that's probably a cumulative number um yes so yeah but yeah if you if you add up it's do you remember that story Jamie yeah what was the story almost what she said there like they just didn't have accounting for it I think yeah it was spent on legitimate things worry but we don't we don't know what we spent it on well I mean how do you know obviously one cannot say it's was spent legitimately if they don't know what it was spent on that doesn't make any sense this is this is such a fascinating time because with this setup the way it is right now with Trump back in after all that happened to him and with you there and with RFK Junior and Tulsi and cash Patel it's like this is a wild time to find out what really going on that's like never happened before this is nothing like the first term no like the first term he had a bunch of neocons in the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady people that he didn't know and he had to appoint all these different people maybe he got some bad picks now he's had four years to Stew on it right and with you guys all going through this we're getting an understanding of the government that we've literally never had before yeah this is a revolutionary cabinet and maybe the most re tionary cabinet since the the first Revolution uh this is this is not a bunch of business as usual uh types so this is why you know some of the the standard confirmations were quite challenging is because when you when you put to try to appoint people who are going to change the system yeah uh the system doesn't want to let them through but it's fascinating because it's like the vampires all out themselves like now everybody knows who the system is like if you're just lying about us and then they come and you talk on aast and expain what's like he's starving mothers there's mothers that can't get food totally false that's all you're hearing yeah that's that's no one's talking in any of these mainstream liberal talk shows no one is talking about all this fraud and waste yeah because we're cutting off their graph machine so that that's what they're upset about that's that's the real thing they're upset about U and if if if people want to know what uh do is cutting and and I want to be clear like these are cuts that Doge recommends to the department and usually these recommendations are followed but uh these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department um the uh you can see line by line what do is done at Doge Dogo so what if we do we put on do. goov so you can see everything that is being done and there's a Tracker that shows is it how much money has been saved yeah yeah and you can look at each line item and and you know they like a bunch of these sort of sort of far left uh shows will will say like oh it's a constitutional crisis blah blah blah but what they won't do is point out which payments are wrong right so my challenge to them is point out which payments are wrong yeah go through it which which of which of these sort of waste fraud things are wrong which line explain that line to the public they won't be able to right yeah that's why you're not hearing any specifics you're hearing an stories about mothers we can name the specifics yeah line by line and we got the receipts and here's the other thing if you're post the receipts and if you're only talking about the propaganda talking points and you're not talking about the very clear fraud and waste it's very obvious what you're doing yeah you're just gaslighting yeah yeah totally yeah so exactly because we're say like look in fact I've said we're going to make mistakes we're not going to be perfect uh so if we make a mistake we'll quickly fix it so we'll we'll we'll you we need to act fast uh so stop wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money um but if if we make a mistake we'll reverse it quickly right you know so it's also this interesting narrative that you shouldn't have access to this social security information as if no one's had access to it before as if the Biden Administration in 2023 had there was like 53 people some of them were students that had access to all this stuff yeah uh as it is there are uh tens of thousands of of federal employees that have access already to the system uh anyone from Doge has to go through the same vetting process that those those federal employees went through so there's not like some unvetted random situation if for example there's a security clearance needed uh the Doge person has to have that same security clearance so there's no um reduction in security um but I mean obviously the the the vast numbers of social security numbers have leaked onto the internet people have hacked the the government systems multiple times uh vast amounts of public information has been hacked and and uh DED on to the Internet so I me there's a guy at the IRS that leaked a half a million tax returns just a few years ago on purpose yeah for what reason uh I for politic he he he he wanted to I think he was trying to get a trump and maybe me and a few others um so but he he he he stole like 500,000 uh tax returns like not a few like it's a lot of tax Jesus Christ yeah oh I remember that story now remember you just you just read about it online it's not it's a real thing so these are the narratives that's the narrative that you shouldn't have access to social security the the other narrative is that starving people are going to die and women aren't going to be pregnant and not have nutrients for their babies and that's that's all you're hearing and um yeah well that's the that's the that's the only thing they they can say but they can point to the line item right um and so they can't say like well this is the thing where you know the nutrients for pregnant mothers were stopped this they can't point to that because we didn't right is a lie what's fascinating to me is um how much the mainstream media is in line with the very specific talking points and how little you you have Fox News you essentially have Fox News on television it's like the only one that is pointing out the ridiculous fraud and waste and yeah you know I know you saw the Jeff Bezos thing in the Washington Post they're going to stop all the wacky editorials and and limit that stuff to uh I think it was uh wealth and personal freedom or something along those lines yeah yeah so I mean I think it's this kind of I think it makes sense uh because he's just talking about the things not not the the sort of just talking about the opinions opinion pieces the opinion pieces yeah yeah so the regular journalism stays the same well it's a detriment to their business I mean you're seeing over and over again people that just they don't want to hear all this [ __ ] from these people anymore it's like you're you're you're saying it's almost like you're caught in an outdated version of the virus and everybody else already has the immunity to that virus like this is yeah you know like you need you need a new mind virus the one that you're pushing it's like it doesn't work anymore it's too crazy yeah uh it's the whole thing is very crazy um I mean the media is incredibly partisan I mean they're not uh I they take almost all the media is um you left shifted yeah so it's like it's kind of weird if you talk to somebody who gets all their information from like what I call Legacy Media uh they're living in a different world yeah uh than if they say are listening to you know U your podcast or um are getting new news from from X or you know just if it's it's like it's it's kind of wild like it is very wild like you talk it's it's like they're living in an Ultimate Reality oh there's a lot of people that I talked to to that I have to go where did you hear that yeah yeah uh but I mean like the Associated Press which I call Associated propaganda the AP um you know they they ran a a international news story saying that we that Doge fired air traffic controllers but we didn't fire any air traffic controllers at all in fact we're trying to hire air traffic controllers not fire them yeah I saw that you you made a tweet about it right yeah what do you call it now do you call it a post post yeah whatever you can't call it a tweet though do you call it a tweet accidentally I don't know listen uh but like if you if if one like let's say somebody post if somebody puts up like an you know two hour long video that's not a tweet right it's a post it's a PO yeah good point yeah yeah for sure yeah so um but I hot over if people still want to call it a tweet whatever you put a post about it just to get back to it saying that if you we need highly qualified air traffic controllers if you retired if you would consider doing it again we could use you uh yes so uh a lot of really qualified air traffic controllers were were pushed out because of Dei stuff so um I mean not to to be blunt I mean a bunch of old white a bunch of really good talented old white guys were pushed out it's not cool um and so we have there's a talent shortage in a traffic control because of Dei and and and not being not hiring people on Merit you know which is so crazy that that worked I think we we should not put the public safety at risk you know because of some demented philosophy somebody made a post today about it in infiltrating the NSA did you see any of that that was that was some gnarly stuff yeah crazy what they they they it started off as just like this sort of Fringe thing and people would meet up then it completely infiltrated the organization and they were spending all their time there like 400 people or something some like some chat sex chat room with like some extremely demented stuff yeah yeah I I know I sa it I'll send it to you Jamie because it's so cooky you you you what this is the NSA I thought the NSA was just all about like information and spy on you know like if like is a national threat or something yeah I think this is exactly it um so she uh more than 100 intelligence staffers will be fired over sexually explicit texts in NSA chat rooms Gabbert says um so so top intelligence official told Waters that the workers in question were Brazen and using an NSA platform intended for professional use to conduct this kind of really really horrific Behavior Uh what is the behavior what exactly what is it do they say in this article uh yeah I think they were also okay it says employees who participate in the n's obscene pornographic and sexually explicit chat rooms your tax dollars at work well it was all like de I it was all like LBGTQ stuff it was there was a lot of like transition stuff and yeah I I know I definitely saved it but point is um it had infiltrated the organization it's not what they should be talking about at all at all at all supposed to be protecting the country right and if you and people were talking about how they're sping half their time in these meetings and that they're just like constantly having to attend these things where they talk about these issues like what are what are you doing like if you have a problem with someone that's discriminatory get rid of that person that's it yes it's you problem's over you got someone who's homophobic in your business they're openly homophobic yeah that you can't work here that's not cool that's it that's it you don't have to have [ __ ] meetings constantly promoting this you're not going to change someone's opinion by berating them over and over again yeah I mean a work environment should be a professional environment where you know they're they're they're getting the job done that they're you know you know being paid to do uh that it should be obviously not supposed to be sort of getting paid for bizarre SE sexcapades it's just so fascinating that the virus was so strong that it made it into the NSA yes and was you would think those are some hard the CIA too the CIA was in there too yeah they were in there too which is bananas you would think same thing like hard-nosed like tough people doing hard work who can spy on you whenever they want yeah yeah and get revenge on you whenever they want yeah pretty wild yeah and you know they exist when the president leaves they stay people move around you stay a part of the organization for your entire career you get deeply entrenched in their system and how things work and who's back to rub and who's who's a bad guy who's a good guy who's on our side who's not yeah it's scary actually yeah um so was that what's taken so long with this Epstein files yeah what's up with that what is up with that it was like yeah it's it's like Lucy and the football with Charlie Brown when she always pulls that football away it's the same thing it's like they keep telling us they're going to release it day one oh day one we have a serious case of no one's being arrested O phobia you know well there's also right like what the [ __ ] is going on what the [ __ ] is going on also there's this real fear that someone's destroying the evidence and you keep hearing these stories unsubstantiated stories yeah of you know FBI people where the evidence I mean the guy had like tons of videos and uh recordings yeah I mean he had all sorts of things right like there's a mountain of evidence right so where's that mountain yeah where where is that mountain and what would be the reason why they would agree like there would have to be something in it for them to agree to not put it out right like there has to be some sort of financial entanglement some sort of relationship with the people that are on that list yeah that they can provide a value that was big enough for you to not release it or to slow relase it or to hope you can get away with like putting out some redacted files that don't show anything this is only red redacted redacted only stage one don't worry the real stuff's coming like that doesn't make any sense like why wouldn't you just release it all like what what could possibly be well worth protecting in there I mean I think I've got probably the same information that I mean I'm just reading what's what's the latest thing on the X you know I'm just looking at my X feed and I'm like yeah you know it's a real page Turner um and like I thought we were going to get some re Revelations to it was like big binders full of stuff there's got to be something in there well there was in all those people that were given a copy of it they were all like waving around they got the Willy Wonka ticket yeah yeah totally yeah and what happened nothing nothing so I think Laura lomer released it online I think I'm watching TW yeah she's not very pleased about this so does anybody find anything in there that's interesting no it's all old stuff from 2015 and okay what the [ __ ] is going on but but then apparently this they discovered a whole bunch of stuff at the southern dist District of New York right so that's and and and I'm like and I me I think you know Pam Bondi is actually great and cash Patel are great but they're like they just got there you know right so then they're they're in not they're they just got there but they're they're in a hostile environment they're not in a friendly environment right um so um you know it's like if you suddenly got put in captain of a ship but the crew was previously your enemy right the entire crew was previously your enemy right you know and you're telling them give me evidence yeah the crew doesn't want to give you the evidence you enemy they were like your mortal enemies just a moment ago you just got there yeah so yeah I think we got to give um you know um the attorney general and you know new director of the FBI some a little bit of slack here because they literally just got there I think so too but hey don't say you're going to release it on day one then yeah you shouldn't have said that sure and don't say you got a big drop coming tomorrow and that's some [ __ ] that's been around forever it's disappointing yeah what the and where's the JFK files where are those yeah let them go did they release anything on that front I don't know what's going on it can't be anything that's gotten to me yet so if nothing's gotten to me yet it can't be signicant if there's conspiracy evidence someone's going to send it yes Tim Dylan's going to text me 100% Tim Dylan Dave Smith someone's going to send my way theu yeah so it has it hasn't been released yet yeah you would find out and here's the real question like what could even be in there at this point that they haven't cleared out if you've got paperwork from 1963 like what is in there still what is in there that could possibly be incriminating that supposedly Trump said that if you saw what they showed me you wouldn't release it either okay what the [ __ ] does that I haven't seen it so Cashel has yes he said he seen it all yeah um can he just post it to his like X account or something I mean I just we that sounds like an Elon move I don't think he can he's the director of the FBI I think he has to go through proper channels and does he he has the channel I yeah but there's rules he sounds like Trump he sound like Trump he needs an executive order what about the storm I am the storm I mean what channels he is the channel well again imagine just getting to the the hull or just getting to the uh deck of the ship and you're the captain yeah and now you uh you have to figure out who's running things who's doing this where is everything yeah um yeah just getting getting anything done like just like said you're you just joined as Captain of a ship of where the crew hates your guts yeah they were your enemy yeah they were your enemy they're strongly opposed to anything you want to do yeah um and you're trying to give them orders and you're trying to expose them yeah they don't want to be exposed right you're you're literally people that are working there probably a part of this problem I mean I I was reading onx that like comey's daughter is like the lead prosecutor in southern district of New York did you read that yes and and like so obviously there's a bit of an entanglement there a little bit like what if there's something that uh you know makes puts her dad in a bad light exactly she a [ __ ] Shredder hit that delete button you know did you see uh General Flynn he was on a podcast and he he spoke directly to James Comey yeah he said Jim you're going to jail and unless you give up someone deeper than you and you know who that is you know who I'm talking about like that is wild yeah um I think that the former director of the FBI might be really in that kind of deep [ __ ] and he really actually was doing some evil corrupt [ __ ] while he run in the FBI I mean it seems like there's some very shady stuff that's been going on um it seems like it definitely happened in the' 60s right everybody kind of admits to that they admit the FBI uh killed black panthers they they did they did a lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of stuff that went on that we know the government did way back in the day yeah why don't we just data dump the files just like go in there take photos of of all the papers presumably paper um and just post it online and and uh let let the CHS fall where they may is it presumably everyone like some like filing cabinet somewhere I don't know right where is it where's where's the magic filing cabinet how are they hiding it who's got access to it like this this is what I was hoping day one I was hoping but obviously it's taking a lot longer than that so I I think part of it is like you know like let's let's say let's say you were made direct to the FBI okay I might be able to that's what crazy literally you know what's he doing now he's he's one of the big dogs of theba but he Secret Service guy yeah legit guy but people think of him as a Fox News guy just like Pete heg same thing they don't want to think about his distinguished military career they want to say oh that Fox News guy director deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation I mean Dan's hardcore I me if he if it's if it's reasonably findable I think he's going to find it this is between him and cash I mean like I think they're going to get stuff how crazy would it be if they couldn't though how crazy would it be if they can't find anything if it's that if if everybody shuts their mouth and everybody covers their ass like an FBI computer where you type in the search that's I I just like the basic mechanism here like it's either in a filing cabinet in in paper where it's like you know maybe there's like Progressive levels of security you know you're like open this door oh you got to have do you have the pass for this level you like level unlocked and there's a level unlocked and it's like get there laptop yeah yeah there's laptop you gotta only plug it in it's in a skiff yeah this is why like I think I think like tour of four KNX would be awesome like a live tour of Fort Knox we can actually see it's like is the C there or not they say it is is it real or did somebody spray paint some lead you know imagine if it's not imagine if it's not all there like some of it's missing where to go what if a lot of it's missing what if like half of it's missing I mean who how do we even know I don't know they said the last time they let someone look at it was decades ago yeah well the last I believe the last formal audit was in the 50s so I'm like okay oh my just think about all the other maybe yeah think about all the other stuff that you pointed out all the the the checks that just go out the the NGO payments the Social Security people think about all just all that now apply that to the gold absolutely I just want to like emphasize the sure Madness of the the government it's it's just because they have like m the Magic Money computers that that they the checks all the checks never bounce for the federal government like so you don't have the the normal corrective mechanism that you'd have for a company or for an individual the checks just always always always clear the net result is inflation which is effectively a tax on everyone um but uh you know like the defense Pro hasn't passed an audit in I don't know how many years seven years yeah I mean exactly so it's like You' have to be freaking Chuck Norris to like only Chuck Norris could get the defense department to pass an order you know typee of thing that's the level of skill you need you know um well that's what's so insane if you bring it back to the idea that it's a business well yeah this would never be tolerated in any kind of functional business exactly so U you know um you know Pentagon will will like like their accounting error like the stuff that that they lose in the couch cushions is like 20 30 B billion dollars a year they don't know don't know where it went it's gone where it go and it's gone it's so insane it's insane it's so insane so that's why I said like even simple things like just requiring that the that outgoing payments for the treasury computer have a payment code and a comment of what the payment is about and someone to call about the payment um I think will have an very powerful effect in stopping wasteful outflows and stopping fraud yeah and and here's another way to look at this imagine if some there are people like you and the Doge team out there in the world imagine if one of those works for an organization like us a or any other organization and has this understanding of how much fuckeries involved but they have evil intentions and they're entwined in this system for decades and decades and they've built a career and all the entanglements that come and they start moving [ __ ] around you could probably do it easy it sounds like the way you've laid it out if you were a career person who's in there forever who knew how everything works Y and you were very clever you could make some [ __ ] happen and you could probably do it in conjunction with some people that you know that are forming an NGO hey let's all work together yeah yeah and this is the resistance that you're facing yeah the I think it's the biggest scam of all time this is not something you ever saw the biggest scam of all time ever of human history of human history yes wow I think you're right yeah I how what else probably a trillion dollar scam there's never been a trillion dollar scam you know now this is not something that you ever set out to do this is not you didn't have this as a career aspiration this is not like this is the most absurd outcome I can possibly imagine actually also like Doge started as like a sort of a a meme coin right you know it was like a a joke cryptocurrency involving memes and dogs mhm um and uh which is so funny that the letters wind up being perfect yeah well actually I was originally going a quote like the government efficiency commission which is very boring name um and then people online were no it needs to be the department of government efficiency uh and I was like you know what you're right of course of course of course I mean it's more evidence of the simulation that that little like a mascot is a is a cute dog it's a meme coin the meme coin is probably worth a lot of money right now right like every time you tweet about it probably I don't know shoots up yeah the the mem the whole meme coin thing is bananas yeah it is so bananas that people dump real money into these coins and then you could just pump them up and sell them a casino or something I don't know yeah it's totally G people just do whatever the greater fo and musical chairs and whoever's like the last to sit down lose type of thing and somehow or another it's still legal like that's that's think not I think not too many people I mean I mean it's sort of like you go to the casino like you if you expect to win at the casino you're being a fool okay so I think if you expect to win at meme coins you're being it's not you're being foolish yeah yeah you're not gonna win a meme coins it's like it's it's but if if if you want like don't sink your life savings into a meme coin no but you can gamble a little and you can ride waves and win a little and lose a little if if you want to have some fun and and don't come then you know play have play with me and coins but if you put your if you put your on a m coin in the at the RIS of saying something bold and outrageous don't bet the F on a mcoin the weird one is the pump and dumps like people all time all the time and people get shocked that somebody pump and dumped like what is what are you doing did you like I was hoping to dump I was hoping to make all the money out of this I can't believe they got me like yeah it's just weird that it's legal still uh I mean casinos IL legal and and people just lose money at casinos you know but you can't rig a casino like a pump and dump you could rig a pump and dump you know uh yeah I guess so um like you could run a real pyramid scheme well I mean the government's one a big pyramid scheme if you ask me yeah well you you can tell Social Security is is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time right explain that oh so um well people pay into Social Security um and and the money goes out of Social Security immediately but the obligation for Social Security is uh your entire retirement career so you're you're paying uh with your the you're paying like like if you look at the future obligations of Social Security it far exceeds uh the tax revenue far have you ever looked at the the the debt The Debt Clock yes okay there's there's there's our present day debt but then there's our future obligations so when you look at the future obligations of Social Security um the actual uh national debt is like double what what people think it is because of the future obligations ah so basically people are living way longer than expected um and uh there are fewer babies being born so you have more people who are retired and get that that live for a long time and get retirement payments so the future obligations so H how bad the financial situation is right now for the federal government it will be much worse in the future at the risk of being a buzz kill here did you see so we better fix what we got right now because if it's bad now it's going to be much worse in the future there was an interview with this woman who was a whistleblower did we ever find out if that was true there's so many whistles being blown it's hard to keep track a lot of whistles this one lady it was only in one state it was very specific instance believe right but it was using Social Security money correct that was her that was her allegation so what what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning uh illegal immigrants into clients that's what they would call them and that she would go to them and try to ask them do you have a headache do you have back problems if you do now you can be permanently disabled you get permanent disability so you get Social Security for Life yes yeah no not just Social Security but disability which is even more right and you get them for on the taxpayer Dole right away the m and they're illegal aliens yes oh so if I were to say like what's at the heart of the sort of like why is a Democrat propaganda machine so fired up to destroy me that's the main reason the main reason is that uh is that um uh entitlements fraud that includes like Social Security Disability Medicaid uh entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here like basically if you if you pay people uh at a standard of living that is above 90% of Earth then you have a very powerful uh incentive for 90% of Earth to come here and to stay here but if you if you end the illegal alien fraud then you that you turn off that magnet and they leave and they they stop coming and and the ones that are here many of them will simply leave and if if that happens a massive they will lose a massive number of democratic voters and if it didn't happen they would turn those people into voters correct which they were trying to do they are already turning them so in in New York state illegal aliens can already vote in state and city elections a lot of people don't don't know that there there's I mean they're trying to fight that in they're trying to stop that but it's there currently I think it's like 600,000 uh are Reg said to vote illegal aliens in New York that is wild yeah well well I mean if you look at say um you know FEMA like the the agency that was paying for illegal aliens to stay at luxury hotels in New York was FEMA the F you know that's meant that that's an agency that's meant to support Americans in distress from natural disasters was paying for luxury hotels for illegals in New York it's true yeah that's a fact fact they're literally like when we stuff that payment we we stopped all those those money because that's obviously an insane way to spend taxpayer money um the uh New York uh sued the government Su the federal government to get the money so you can just look at their lawsuit they they were give they were sending that money even after president Trump signed an executive order saying it needs to to stop they still press sand on $80 million to luxury hotels in New York your tax money went to pay for illegal aliens in luxury hotels in New York from an agency that is meant to help Americans in distress from natural disasters right and I would like to know how much and I would like to know how much they spent on North Carolina and how much they spent on Maui yes exactly uh what What's actually happened is they're buying voters that's really what's happening it's like it's like a giant voter for scam they're importing voters and uh and it's really just a matter of time so like a lot of people have trouble believing this but if you the more you look at it the more you will realize just how much of a problem this is and how it's it's it's not just real it is it is an attempt to destroy Democracy in America that's what in my view it is what it really is like if you take the the the sort of seven swing States like often the imin of Victory there is like maybe 20,000 votes if you put 200,000 um illegals in there and they have like a 80% likelihood of voting them uh and it's only a matter of time before they become citizens then those swing States will not be swing states in the future and if they are not swing States we will be a permanent one party State country permanent uh deep blue socialist State that's what America will become and that was the game plan that that was that was the game plan that is still the game plan and they almost succeeded if if if if the if the machine of which the Kam puppet was the representation had won that's what would have happened the reason I went so hardcore for for for for Trump was because to me this was a folk in the road very like a very obvious folk in the road um if they had another four years they would legalize enough illegals in the swing states to make the swing States uh not swing States they would just there would be blue States then then they would they would win the presidential they'd win the house the Senate and the presidency um they would then make uh District you know DC into a state may maybe Puerto Rico get four extra Senators pack the Supreme Court so then you'll have the house Judiciary Senate uh and presidency all blue and then they will keep importing more illegals to cement that that outcome basically what happened in California Jesus Christ it would have been the end that's why I went so hardcore for for trump it was otherwise been the end and that's why the the the Democrat machine is so intent on destroying me it's just so fascinating that people can't see this I mean I invite people to do their research the more they do their research the more they will see that what I'm saying is absolutely true D it's like just do the research yeah it's it's such a bad idea even for the Democrats which is what they don't understand like it's the same it's not ultimately going to work out no it's the same people yes it's just they're doing it under the guys that they're the kind compassionate Progressive people yes but the same outcome takes place it's just about control they they probably Institute some Central Bank digital currency and some social credit score system and censorship of course yeah of course well they that was the big Fe coming into this election was that if they can't censor things like well I we talked about it before but there's there was two major Forks in the road the big one was Trump didn't get shot y the other big one was You by Twitter and if those two things don't happen the whole world looks different yes yeah we don't want to be on that timeline no we don't want to have only one side represented because guess what they will hijack that side whatever it is they will hijack that side and use it for money and control and that's what it's all about it's not about good people versus bad people it's a [ __ ] shell game yeah I I mean I think these things are actually it's easy to understand if you look at basic incentives the the basic incentive here is the more legals that the Democrats can bring in the more likely they are to win so that's what they're going to do um that's what they have been doing uh and it worked in California California super majority Dem um and look at all the companies that are leaving California yeah um I mean in and- out just announced they're leaving their headquarters leaving California they're moving to Tennessee yeah yeah so um and and California uh made Healthcare free for illegals yeah as of last year so and and that obviously that's a gigantic magnet for more illegals like and this is not a thing you can solve simply with money because what happens is the you simply have more patients than a doctor can possibly see and you can't just you know make doctors out of nothing like the it so people like oh it's just a money thing no you it takes a long time for somebody to become a doctor you know the 30 years um and uh and so what actually happens in California is that there are too many patients for the doctors to see so then uh the average citizen in California suffers as a result um now the the elite in California are fine because they have private doctors you know they have they can they can just pay for the best doctors so the elite in California doing fine but your your average C citizen in California is not doing fine um and the the tax burden for uh healthcare for illegals was supposed to be three billion I think they now estimated it's 9 billion but that but that that number will scale to Infinity basically it's like why not like why not if you if you need any operation at all come to California and have it be free right from anywhere on earth and the people that want to look at it in the most charitable way they say oh well these people are hardworking good people and they're the backbone of our city and they should have access to all the things that we have access to and I just don't think they understand that it's a political Pawn I don't think they understand this is not done for compassion and kindness no this is just done to ensure that it stays Blue correct yeah and it's essentially a bribery with your tax dollars yes this is why um that the dams will not even um Deport criminals yeah um because every criminal deported is a lost vote so even even if if somebody is uh um illegal with a criminal record and commits crime in America they are still still were not being deported and then on top of that California made it actually illegal to ask for ID when people vote Yes California and New York uh you are not allowed to show your ID when you vote I just want to be clear so everyone understands this in California New York you are not allowed to show your ID even if you want to right why would that ever be a good idea I mean what like if you want to man if you're trying to do if you're trying to facilitate fraud in elections it's a great idea that's the only reason yes there's no other reason Lally why that would be a good idea it's for fraud it's it's like it's like wake up she wake up hello like let's say you wanted to commit for what are the things you would do yeah you would say you don't need ID and you can mail in your ballot and we'll give you free healthare yes stay here yes stay here I know it's on fire but stay here I mean in this case it being on fire is not just a metaphor in California okay it's just like godamn entire neighborhood's burning down it's just once they uh allowed people to vote that are not legal in California once you if you're if you're going to do that it's it's over it's exactly there's there's no coming back from that the numbers are just no people are so indoctrinated too there's so many people that no matter what they think voting Republican means you're an [ __ ] yes and they won't do it they won't do it they they'll put their [ __ ] rainbow flag on their porch and they'll just ride it right into the beach civilizational suicide yeah right to the Rocks bang crash the boat I mean uh there's there's a guy um who post X who's who great God Gods side yeah friend of mine he been on podcast punch times yeah he's awesome yeah he's great um and he talks about uh you know basically suicidal empathy mhm like if there's like there's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself yeah um so that we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on and it's like I believe in empathy like I think you should care about other people but you need to have empathy for for civilization as a whole and not commit to a civilizational suicide also don't let someone use your empathy against you so they can completely control your state and then do it insanely bad job of managing it and never get removed the the the fundamental weakness of Western Civilization is empathy the empathy exploit they there it's it's they're exploiting a a a bug in western civilization which is the empathy response so and I I I think you know empathy is good but you need to think it through and not just be programmed like a robot right understand when empathy has been actually used as a to a tool yes like the it's weaponized empathy yeah is the issue yeah weaponized empathy and yeah um and it's also the rigid adherence to that liberal ideology like you can't switch sides over there like California if you're a part of that whole Tech Hollywood entertainment any any of those circles you're on the left like almost wholly almost completely it's borderline illegal to be a republican in California uh I mean like in San Francisco or La it's borderline illegal to be a republican you're certainly shunned no I look I mean in like San Francisco you you you could shoot heroin while taking a dump on the mayor's car in front of City Hall okay and and that and nothing would happen to you but if you walk down the street with a Maga hat you're GNA get attacked yeah it's insane yeah it's insane it's also so orwellian that a hat that says make America great again would cause people to have a violent reaction like aren't you American wouldn't just just as a a whole like the saying wouldn't that be a good thing for everyone make America great again but because it's attached to Donald Trump and that red hat you'll get maced for wearing that red hat they will make America worse by beating you so it's like it's an evil thing they're doing a violent assault in America because you want to make America great again I mean it's like a scene in a book it doesn't it doesn't seem like it could be that ridiculous like remember when all lives matter would get you fired which is insane insane people got fired because they said all lives matter which is a very reasonable thing to say how reasonable is that yes that's essentially saying everybody matters but that's not that's Lally all you're saying that's not what you were supposed to say you had to say black lives matter which of course they do if you say all lives matter everybody matters yes but the idea of being a colorblind Society was completely abandoned somewhere around 2012-ish yeah I mean I I sort of can trace it to when when did the the the gun emoji get nerfed you know uh when did it turn into a squirt gun that was a couple of years ago that was like 2016 I think was it yeah yeah it became a squirt gun can you bring it back X yeah no no right now if if if you uh use a gun emoji on X the Apple will insist that it' be a squirt gun and then the X app turns it back into uh a 1911 oh really yeah oh that's great so you can you can actually uh you know have have a 1911 gun um we we we reverted the Apple change inside the app oh that's hilarious that's hilarious that that it's that thing's so offensive the gun and then the pregnant man both of those got me like you [ __ ] I mean I like that mem where it's like the people telling you that what you're hearing is dis information are the same people that did the pregnant man emoji yes yeah think about that yeah well also the same people that say a woman attacked a Tesla Factory yeah the woman it's a dude it's a dude like really obvious dude really big mentally ill dude yeah mentally ill dude with a wig on say that yes yeah but NBC even fo you're looking at the picture a woman yo this is got a this this is a dude with a wrong jawline okay he's wearing Woman face is a buff it's a buff dude yeah it's a buff dude wearing Woman face I mean come on that's not a that's not a woman yeah and they're like saying watch shot for disinformation I'm like what are you talking about it's so crazy this is [ __ ] I mean it's just more evidence of the virus though right like it killed objectivity killed reality and it it demanded strict adherence or you were attacked yeah yeah any questioning of it uh would result in in being ostracized do you like what what kind of responsibility do you like knowing that if you didn't take over Twitter and turn it into X if that didn't happen like the I really think the world's a very different place right now like how long have you owned it for a couple years basically imag imagine a couple years of it being run the way it was run before and probably accelerating my account would have been suspended long ago for sure yeah for sure yeah just for the disinformation yeah um it would have been Trum would have never come back Alex Jones would have definitely never been back definitely not no no um so yeah um does that weigh on you like I would feel like that would be a [ __ ] heavy responsibility yeah um I mean I'm just trying to keep civilization going here you know for longer um so um I think we at least want to build a city on Mars um and become a multiplet civilization uh which I think would be incredibly important in ensuring the long-term survival of civilization are you still rescuing those people that are stuck in the space station uh yeah that's coming up in a couple weeks I think whoa they've been up there for how long Jamie they were supposed to be there for a couple days right I think actually prob like four weeks oh they're supposed to be they were supposed to be up there for like eight days yeah and they've been up there for like I think eight months so a little longer than expected [ __ ] yeah what is it going to be like for those people when they get back they're going to be a wreck for a long time right yeah if as long you stay up there you get you know sort of in zero you get increased bone loss so um you it ended up being like this political football um and uh sort of sort of hotly contested topic um we offered to bring them back early this offer was rejected by the Biden Administration whyl for political reasons that's so crazy I there's no way that they're going to make anyone who's supporting Trump look look good wow what do you think they would have done if they had won uh well get those people back no they can they can only get them back with with a SpaceX spacecraft but they they push the return date past the uh inauguration date wow yeah so they would have let you do it but after the wow and so it would have been them authorizing you there isn't anyone else to to to do it NASA can't get them uh the only only the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back so the NASA concluded that the Boeing spacecraft was not safe so that's why they're stuck there holy [ __ ] yeah and you can't ask Russia to help that would be awkward a little bit yeah yeah be a nice thing if they did they said guys will help you I think they for enough money they would you think so uh yeah but they would they would obviously treat it as a propaganda Victory and charge crazy money it's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool yeah um yeah um so well they were also the Biden Administration was also suing SpaceX uh they had this massive lawsuit against SpaceX for SpaceX not hiring Asylum Seekers right so so people like say like oh El's making it up this V Administration wasn't against SpaceX I'm like bro the Department of Justice had a massive lawy law suit against SpaceX for not hiring Asylum Seekers even though it is illegal for us to hire hire anyone who is not a permanent resident so it is both there's a law that says you have to hire Asylum Seekers but there's also a law that says anyone hired by a rocket company which is an advanced weapons technology must be a permanent resident and if an asylum Seeker is not a permanent resident so it is both legal and illegal to hire Asylum Seekers so why would the vien Administration launch a massive lawsuit again this is public information it's not like my imagination um why would they launch do such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX they're extremely antagonistic it just doesn't make any sense that that could ever even get past the first day of someone looking at it if it's both illegal and you're trying to enforce it like you can't enforce it yes this is an advanced weapons company this is crazy it should be like this throw this out there's in fact there's like International traffic and arms regulations is a like a law that is there to ensure that if if only permanent residents of the United States can work at Advanced weapons companies Rockets are Advanced weapons uh so the same is true of like if it's like nuclear or you know some like you know bioweapon thing or something like that um so because they obviously if if someone were to work at basic and then go leave and go to North Korea or Iran they could build missile technology that could uh you know destroy the United States so that's why you're not allow to hire people who are per resident logical basic logical logical so is that lawsuit still pending I was it was just dismissed how long was it going on for a couple years holy [ __ ] yeah that's the other thing that drives me crazy like that people don't understand that if you sanction laware like that if you sanction attacking your political enemies someone's going to do that to you like if the wrong people get in office yeah if new people getting off four years from now eight years from now who knows who it's going to be you've already set a precedent you've already attack someone charged them with 34 felonies where they're really just misdemeanors and they're passed the statute of limitation and now you're talking all over the news that this is a convicted felon convicted felon they kept saying convicted felon convicted felon and everybody knows what it is yes it's terrifying it's terrifying they could do it so brazenly to a guy who was the president for four years right um that lawsuit was funded by Reed Hoffman uh who is a major damned donor and also an FD and client [Music] uh the pl the plot thickens the plot thickens Jesus Christ yes it's just it's so blatant it's like so obvious the SpaceX lawsuit the Trump stuff it's just it's so obvious yes like known FC clients um who are obviously extremely powerful um they powerful politically and and very wealthy um are you know bullate um Bill Clinton and Reed Hoffman and some others two but those three so you know why was Reed Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump do you think it's because they're worried about the list coming out yeah one of the reasons yeah so I mean I'm like this is you know yeah so it's so frustrating to be sitting in the situation where the the list isn't coming out well it better come out I mean hopefully tomorrow might well I mean why' they release [ __ ] today I don't know what's the point in giving these people like a a happy folder to wave around in front of the camera with nothing in it that's new doesn't make any sense it's not encouraging uh like I said it's the tough thing that they've got is you know they've been made captain of a ship with a hostile crew right right so they don't have like you it's not like you you have like magical powers you get made captain of a triple the Hostile crew you still have a hostile crew right um you've got to bring in people who are going to you be helpful as opposed to OB obstructionist right um so um but yeah I think the the public will be right frustrated if there is if no one is prosecuted for the FC Client List no one at all which you don't know like is you know like at least I don't know the top five or something like some number should there should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders well particularly if galain Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking yes cuz like well trafficking sex trafficking occurred right so she was in she's in jail for it yes so to who are the clients yeah yeah how do you put someone in jail and you don't even name the clients that sounds kind of insane I think yes it it it would yes because just stunning that they've been able to hold it back for so long it's really kind of amazing like when people say that people can't keep secrets what the [ __ ] are you talking about look at this yeah I mean a bunch of these things are not like it's it's common knowledge but we just we don't actually have the proof right um so the proof is there I mean there's lots of videos um yeah there's lots I mean the dude it's like a mountain of like whenever they raided fen's place there would have been like a mountain of evidence where is that mountain right what' you do with it yes like Who took possession of the evidence yeah specifically right the individuals where are the tapes yes how many levels of clearance do I have to get to get into the Vault Yeah well yeah yeah um you know what we need are people who are really good with computers oh yeah and really good with technology remember seeing this photo that's when they raided his home they were that's they on the island they were there then yeah they got everything I'm sure I mean there must have been so much stuff on that island there must have been and if it wasn't there where was it yeah what you know it has to be uploaded somewhere there has to be some sort of a chain of evidence yeah or chain of custody there got to be a mountain of of evidence yeah um the other thing they're going to talk about is uh uaps they're going to release all the UAP information so you're the GU to ask about this what what if any possibility is there that there is some sort of advanced propulsion system technology that's being worked on in secret and that they're trying to cover this up with this talk of aliens and alien Tech and not of this world and is it possible that there's some sort of very secret program that's going on in cahoots with some defense contractors that are developing Advanced propulsion systems that they're using for these drones uh I mean SpaceX um you know my company SpaceX is has the most advanced rocket technology in the world I think I'd know right um and I the best of my knowledge there is not any magic there there's not like some super Advanced propulsion technology there have been people who have theorized different gravity drives and different is there anything that's ever gotten past the theoretical stage no nothing well there's nothing even that I'm aware of that works in theory it's not like I don't I I would like this to exist to be clear I would like this to exist um and I have the I I I from a security clearance standpoint I have top top secret there there is I have equivalent of like an all access pass from a security clearance standpoint so uh I I'm I don't think they're hiding it from me basically I don't think they they could um unless it's completely in these weapons manufacturing corporations I mean I know these weapons manufacturing companies like boing lucky to northr I mean yeah they do some interesting things but uh they do not have I there's no breakthrough that they have so I'm confident they do not have a breakthrough when you hear people like like why just compete with SpaceX and make a better rocket in which case you know they can make why are they holding back on making um a lot of money from beating SpaceX with better Rockets my thought was that what if it's just a drone and you can't have a biological entity inside of it because it just bursts from the [ __ ] speed that it's moving at that a human couldn't tolerate the amount of force so they're just drones I don't think so so what do you think people like Ryan Graves Commander David I want cool things to exist like say like do I want UFOs to exist yes I want UFOs to exist because that would be really interesting course everybody does yeah it would be cool it's it's a more boring world where UFOs don't exist or or like flying like Advanced propulsion stuff doesn't exist that's a if if it doesn't exist that's more boring I'd like it' be more interesting if it did exist I'd like it to exist I hope we find something but I have not seen like I mean like SpaceX has launches 90% of all satellite Mass to orbit so if you take all of Earth uh rocket all of Earth's rocket launchers my company has a 90% market share of Earth China does about 5% and the rest of the world does including the Boeing lock North and everyone does 5% so why why wouldn't they use this to defeat SpaceX yeah yeah would no listen that's why I asked you it would make sense what do you think these people are seeing a rocket every two days but what do you think these people are seeing when when you have reliable people like Commander David fraver who had that Infamous ticktock uh Tic Tac experience off the coast of San Diego where they got this thing on video they tracked it going 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 ft in like a second okay yeah yeah and then they also have video evidence of this thing accelerating at a great speed eyewitness accounts from two different Jets sure um I mean can we does anybody have a high-risk video or photo of this thing well there's a video of this thing where they're locked onto it and and then it takes off it shoots off frame no no it's like whatever the systems they used on fighter jets in 2004 potentially like Windows 95 I me there like somebody did a curve of like the resolution of UFOs and the resolution of cameras U UFO resolution has stayed flat despite megapixels and cameras going like you know super high well according to Christopher Mel why they still blurry Christopher melan who worked in the state department said that they have high resolution photos videos of these things and that's all that he's seen it it's all locked away whenever people say that to me like don't even tell me that then don't unless you have just leak it for God's sake put it out there like let it slip yes yeah uh I mean there's a couple photos they're grainy there's not one thing that I've ever looked at and go holy [ __ ] that's it that's what I've looking for you could ask our Gro AI right now to create a h highres image of of an alien spacecraft uh you know over Austin yeah and it's going to do a great job so why we do we not have at least that right yeah but I want to believe that's the problem my brain starts going oh come on this is no fun I want it to be real I want there to be at least be some Advanced propulsion system if not like what are all these people seeing like what is h if we're not being occasionally visited by things that are smart enough to hide we might be I just that these aliens are very subtle yeah you keep saying saying that it's a good good line I mean it's a solid line cuz it's pretty accurate I just want to see some high RIS video of aliens like how are they just evading all the cameras if you think about that and the ones that you do get them on that's just like some Far Away light that's moving weird and it could be a lot of things but I want to believe yeah I mean I mean there've been like multiple times where um you know the Air Force and navy is has called SpaceX and as and said they they they think they've seen aliens and we're like was it at this time on this state in this location they're like yes how do you know that's us there been a lot of that that's our satellites those are our satellites they're like no they're not I'm like yeah yeah they're they're definitely our satellites oh yeah people see the SpaceX satellites all the time whing by yeah they're last our satellites and they're they are moving at you know 16,000 mil hour so it's pretty fast um and there's also stuff that the United States government does have that gets mistaken for UFOs I remember the first time I saw a stealth bomber we were filming Fear Factor it was like right after uh 2003 like right after the the war had broken off and they were flying a stealth bomber down in Palmdale I was like holy [ __ ] like if I didn't know what that was I would 100% think that's from another world when you see cool [ __ ] cool yeah really cool I mean it doesn't look like a a humans it looks like something from battl Star Galactica you know it does look yeah it does look awesome um I mean they're they're not stealthy against any uh Advanced radar system by the way it doesn't work it doesn't work anymore doesn't work no was it old school stuff they're they're only they're only stealthy against uh old Radars oh okay I mean you can still see them like they're not invisible right right they're not like oh it's not like you know uh cloaking device from Star Trek did you see when me and Lex uh we we watched the the rocket get caught live while while it was happening that to me was one of the to see it actually I've seen videos of it happen but to see it actually live was one of the coolest [ __ ] things you're like wow we are in the future right I mean nobody else can do that yeah it's true nobody else can do that that's fact yeah it's pretty wild it's cuz I'm an alien it's time you I'm an alien and I keep trying telling people I'm an alien but they don't believe me I believe you okay thank you I believe you that's my my suspicion all along was that you I'm trying to get back to my own planet that you're a friendly alien like it's nothing wrong with aliens I like people from everywhere yeah even other planets what's next like now that you can do that you can catch Rockets what's like the ultimate expression of Rocket technology like what what comes after this um well I mean the fundamental breakthrough we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital rocket where both stages are fully and rapidly reusable with our Falcon rocket we are able to reuse the main stage and the the nose cone but we're we're not able to reuse the upper stage um and it it's still takes us a you know at least a few days from when the main stage lands to when we can flly a gain so it it doesn't it doesn't it's it's doesn't it's not fully reusable because we lose the upper stage uh which cost $10 million to build and um and then and then the the main stage it's it's not as reusable as like an aircraft you can't just like refuel it and fly it requires um work for a couple days um but this the Starship design is the first design that is capable of full and Rapid reusability where that is one of the possible outcomes um and once you have full and Rapid reusability the cost of access to space drops by a factor of 100 it's like 100 times cheaper um by some metrics it's a thousand times cheaper and um and then when when you factor in uh orbital re re refilling so you refill on orbit uh it it can drop the cost of going cost per ton to the surface of Mars by a factor of 10,000 whoa yeah so what has to improve in order to make it reusable um well um we need there's there's some like we're pretty close to being able to re rapidly reuse the booster for Starship um that's why you know it it comes back and gets caught by the arms and then the arms place it back in the launch Mount so um now this still you know um we have a little bit of engine damage we got little bit of heat shield damage um there's uh like there's like tweaks that that are needed but but the but we're pretty close to achieving full and Rapid reusability of the of the booster um the ship we we we're I mean I I think we'll achieve reusability of the ship this year um and I think we'll achieve rapid reusability of the whole stack ship and booster next year um this is the fundamental breakthrough required for life to become multiplanetary and what is what needs to improve in order to make it reusable like what is what's wrong with it right now uh on the shift side the the toughest problem is the heat shield so no no one has actually no one has ever developed a fully reusable orbital heat shield because you come when you come in from orbital velocity you come in like a flaming meteor like you're just a raging ball of fire um and it's it's hard to have a heat shield that doesn't partially melt or get destroyed in that process um you know that that wasn't a problem we were able to solve with falcon9 that's why the opper stage uh burns up on re-entry um with the with Starship the the the the ship portion you got the the booster and you got the ship um we got to solve the making a fully reusable orbital heat shield a problem that has never been solved before um for a while I was like I'm not sure there's this is solvable at this point I think it is solvable um it requires detailed iteration on the heat shield tiles um and I mean we've vertically integrated the manufacturing of the heat shield tiles because there there was no supplier that could provide us with the materials that were needed so the um you need to make essentially this this very fine verelli of of glass and aluminum oxide uh fibers um aluminum oxide is basically Sapphire so it's like glass and Sapphire very fine fibers in exactly the right geometry uh with special Coatings um in order to have the this heat shield tile be reusable um like not melt um and but not be so brittle that it gets damaged um on Ascent or descent um like it can't be as you know it's it's kind of like almost the brittleness of a coffee cup type of thing um and the Rocket's shaking like hell so you got this thing like you saw it firstand like imagine you're at Ground Zero of that rocket like you feel how much shaking it was when you're like 5 miles away imagine if you're right there you know so you got you're shaking these things that are like as brittle as a coffee cup trying not to have them crack or break um and then not have them melt um you got several thou several thousand of these things um you know and if even a few of them break it's not reusable so is there Innovation that's being done in the materials technology at SpaceX where you're you're constantly trying to find and tweak a better version of this yes it's a very difficult problem no it's a problem no one has ever solved so we've got to get the exact right uh materials combination uh the the right molecules in the right shape and and then apply those that heat shield perfectly to the rocket with no mistakes um there's a reason that no one solved this before it's a very difficult problem so um like said we we had to vot integrate the entire manufacturing of the tile from basic raw materials to a finished tile um rebuild like build the entire supply chain from basic raw materials so where you're just inputting uh silicon uh silicon and aluminum oxides and what is the difference between the way you guys do it versus the way they used to do it for the space shuttle uh well I mean the the space shuttle um like space shuttle Leading Edge uh used uh like quite dense Caron Caren tiles like it was um they're like basically thick and heavy uh but also subjected to cracking that's like what what happen is the foam broke off and it's it hit the tile cracked the tile then on Entry the the cracked the tiles that have been cracked or broken uh weren't able to Shield the the shuttle and so the the the the plasma got in melted the the primary structure the whole the whole Space shut broke apart yeah so you you can't basically can't have something that's as brittle you know brittle like the space shuttle there's footage of that right yeah yeah um uh and Rain debris over the whole United States so yeah and they got almost all the pieces um the the I mean the full the full technical explanation would would would I think be understood by about six people um listening to this um like the there was a lot of brilliant engineering the space shuttle tiles um and and and and a bunch of the heat shielding wasn't even tiles it was actually uh silica blankets like you know um felt blankets essentially um if you look closely you'll see it actually is uh they're actually Heat Blankets not not tiles in in some areas um but but they they would have crack tiles and they would have occasionally the tiles would fall off there were a few close calls U where tiles fell off but they weren't in a super vulnerable position uh in the on the space shuttle um so but it would take it would take them several months like eight nine months to refurbish a space shuttle between each flight so it was it was it was not reusable really um and and certainly wasn't rapid so um like I said very hard problem U you've got to have you you've also got to ATT sort of attach the tiles in a way that um enables the the structure underneath to move uh to expand and contract ah um even though you've got these very rigid tiles um so like the the main the the tanks which take on cryogenic propellant will contract when you put in the cryogenic propellent but then when you come in and you get very hot they will expand so now you're you're expanding the you're Contracting and expanding the gap between these rigid tiles but how much uh it varies depending on where you are on the on the on the vehicle so if you're in the um if you're in the cryogenic tank section like the I mean you can see like a 10 20% difference in the Gap um really it's pretty significant yeah it's enough that you can't just put all the tiles you can't just Jam the tiles together if you if you put them to if you if you actually but buted them up um they would they would all crack because there's too much movement there's there's also some amount of body bending so as the the ship is like ascending uh you know when when the engines steer there's a little bit of movement um so if the tiles are too close together they they'll they'll essentially just crack and snap like how you have to have a gap like how PL yeah like plain Wing will move yeah plain body will move too wow and how you have to have some Gap but if you have too much of a gap then the the the heat gets gets to the you know get gets past the the tile and uh melts the the structure holy [ __ ] it's a hard and how large are these tiles I mean they're like that big that's it well they're not all exactly the same size but yeah we're sort of a hexagonal tile and they have to essentially be you can't like 3D print the whole thing you can't have one structure it has to be tiles because it has to have that ability to move well there's no 3D printer that's I mean the biggest ones are like maybe 3et you know there's no you you can't you print it um nor nor would you you have to have something that can move right uh it has to be able to fle to flex um like so you got expansion and contraction um you you're really D like you're you know you're um you're putting in liquid oxygen which is likeus 300° fah um actually we we subcool it to you know- 330 Dees fah um so it's very cold and then it will be several hundred degrees maybe a th000 deges fahit potentially um in went on re-entry so you have this huge temperature swing so the the thermal expansion is substantial and the whole and you got thermal expansion and contraction combined with body bending so you have to take the worst case Body vending and thermal expansion contraction this was a very hard problem yeah yeah Del delicate balance but you're confident that you guys are going to be able to crack it at this point I I I'm confident that it is solvable yeah it just needs a certain amount of versions of it that's why when these things blow up you're like yeah we expect them to blow up yeah what would be really helpful is for us to get the ship back um so we can study where like where we had cracked tiles or lost tiles why why did we you know why did we have a cracked all L tiles was because maybe the tiles were the Gap was too big too small maybe there was a a height difference between the tiles um maybe we need to change the chemical composition um you know there's we we just want if we can get the dam ship back intact we can we can iterate a lot better um which we'll get it back intact um so I think we'll get it back intact this year um but that that's why I think we we'll we'll probably recover the ship sometime this year and then um we might be able to refly one with a but probably with a fair bit of work by the end of this year but it's going to take us many iterations before we can achieve rapid reusability where the ship comes back lands get gets caught like the booster with the arms and can then and then arms plac it on top of the booster and it launches again whoa so like I said that's you know reduce cost of access to space by a factor of 100 and what is the process of returning these people that are stuck in the space station well we we we I mean we send SpaceX dragon to the space station all the time and we've um we've now taken people to orbit and back was taking over 50 people over over 50 astronauts so it's just a matter of doing it yeah and is it a matter of waiting for we do it routinely basically it's not a we've we've been doing this for a few years so when is this Rescue Mission going to launch um yeah probably about um um about four weeks or so it's depending on weather and other considerations uh about it's about a month away well that'll be uh I'm sure a welcome moment for those poor people that are stuck up there so so it's a bit of a political football so they're not going to complain um no I'm sure they're football but obviously we we could have brought them back way sooner that's so [ __ ] up so let's let's take it past the point where you have these scales you have a reusable ship yeah and you've you've got it dialed in then what are the steps what are what what's next step after that is it an unmanned ver Voyage to Mars first unmanned fly to Mars um the Earth and Mars um orbit synchronize every two years um or every 26 months technically so um the next orbital synchronization is November of next year so and you can launch plus minus a month roughly so we'd have to launch in November or December of next year and so the the default plan is to launch hopefully several Starships to Mars at the end of next year and what would they be doing well at first we're just going to try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing um do do we succeed in landing like let's say we were able to send five ships do all five land intact or do we uh add some craters to m um if we add some craters we've got to be bit more cautious about sending people you know and we need to so we got to make sure the thing lands safely how does it land on Mars uh with on Rockets Rus so it'll just land oh we'll add legs okay it'll just land and have legs and so it'll be remote controlled from Earth or just autonomous autonomous completely Mars is uh you can't remote control things from Earth because Mars yeah it's too far speed light you have speed light constraints so um Mars at closest approach is roughly four light minutes um and uh when it's on the other side of the sun it's it's about 12 light minutes so you know round trip would be like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on the other side of the Sun so once you do that then how long do you think before you start sending people up there um well we're going to try to go as fast as possible um you can think of this as really um a Race Against Time can we make Mars self-sufficient before civilization has some sort of Future Folk in the road where there's either like a a war nuclear war or something or a we get hit by a meteor um or or simply civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a bang um I think we can do this in I don't know at least I think we do it within 15 Earth Mars synchronization events you know so basically like 30ish um if if we have an exponential increase in you if if every year if every two years we have like a a major increase in um the number of people in tonage to Mars like I I think as a rough approximation we need about a million tons to the surface of Mars maybe a million people that kind of thing to actually have a civilization yeah the and would you terraform like what would you do you would eventually terraform at first people would live in some kind of protected environment like domes and underground kind of thing um terraforming would take too long um I we're at this point in time where in the for the first time in the 4 and a half billion year history of Earth it is possible to extend Consciousness beyond our home planet and um that window may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time I hope it's open for a long time uh but it might only be open for a short time and uh we should just make sure that we extend the light of Consciousness to Mars before some uh before civilization either extinguishes or subsides you know all that all that needs to happen is that the technology level of Mars drops below or technology level of Earth drops below what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars so if there's some really destructive war or like I said some natural cataclysm um or or simply the birth rate is so low that you know we just like I said die in adult diapers with a whimper that's one of the fossil outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way by the way so Japan is Right Japan Korea yeah yeah I mean at at at dangerously yeah at current birth rates in three generations Korea will be about 4% of its current size that's insane yeah maybe maybe even less than that um they're they're only at 1/3 replacement rate so if you if you have three generations that one that's you're 127th uh of your current population which is 3% dis Jesus Christ yeah basically population class laughs happens fast um so and seems to be accelerating in most parts of the world so so basically I mean from my standpoint I'm like this is the first time it's been possible to extend life extend Consciousness beyond Earth maybe that window will be open for a long time but it might only be open for a short time we should make sure that we make life multiplanetary and make Consciousness multiplanetary while it's possible well that's the goal goal of SpaceX it's ly a smart goal if you take into consideration how vulnerable this planet really is I mean there there's always some new story about something that might come and hit us 30 years from now it's a 3% chance and and we really can't stop that right now right I mean there's really we don't really have the technology currently to even know how many rocks are coming our way right there's stuff that comes behind the Sun that we can't see until it's pretty close then it's our way yeah now what is the fear of your It's a Long Journey to Mars you're sending people it's a six month how many months will it take six uh yeah six months roughly what about stuff that's out there like how much of a fear is it of micr meteors or any of the possibilities what can you do to mitigate that uh I I think actually I mean space is very empty like once you get out of Earth orbit space is is like kind of unnervingly empty it's is just like like when we send spacecraft to Mars they just it's not like oh we lost the spacecraft because it got hit by a microm meteorite um that's not that's not been the cause of any any TR to Mars that like no no TR to Mars have failed because of micr meteorites um now a dragon spacecraft which operates in lowth orbit um does have microm meteorite Shields has micromor it has shielding um and microm meteorite shielding is like it's different from normal shielding CU like you get hit by something that's moving at like you could have a relative velocity of like maybe 30 or 40,000 miles per hour um yeah it's very very fast um or or just thought of another way call it um you know 10 to 20 times the the velocity of a bullet from an assault rifle and what are you what are you using yeah so well it's it's interesting you actually in order for microm meteorite protection if you have any like anything that's solid it will just it will just push that chunk of Sol solid stuff right through so if you had like a solid plate of aluminum or steel the the micrometeorite would would go right through it um so what you actually need to do is have a gap um so you have an initial uh like hard hard surface the hard metal surface that the micrometeorite hits it then atomizes into an into a conical spray like an atomic spray so you have a it's important to have that Gap so the micrometer can hit something hit the first layer uh at atomize after hitting the first layer then it turns into an atomic like a a a cone of atoms that then embed themselves in the second layer you need like maybe a couple inches of Gap wow yeah that's how my communite shielding Works how many times can it get hit well the outer Shield if it gets hit in the same place you're going to be well it's going to have a hole Yeah wherever the where wherever that you know micromite object hit you're going to have a hole um and it's like the the energy is so great that it just like it just atomizes just into a cone basically um a cone of atoms um but then those atoms then embed themselves in the second layer so what what can you do if it's you're sending the ship up it gets hit with a microm meteorite and then you have to return it do you have to repair it before you return it or is it capable of still withstanding the Heat and then shaking in the temperature with that hole in it when it re-enters um well depending on where that hole is you're more or less likely to have a problem I mean if the if you if if you hit the main heat shield uh the main heat shield really is you've got a high risk of of not making it back so the the the it's why like microm medial shielding it's like it's it's a it's slightly helpful but it's it's not going to NE like for Starship I wouldn't recommend having micrometer right shielding like if if if you do punch a hole just plug the hole basically um the the micrometer micromite shielding it doesn't work well on the on the primary heat shield it works it works pretty well on the on the back shell on the on the leward side of the heat shield where basically that there's not that much heat but if it if if you got hit with a microm meterorite on the the main Dragon heat shield the the bottom like if you look at dragon dragon spacecraft it looks like a gumdrop shape MH and it it enters with the the the wide side of the Gumdrop down um you can see the that's that's the that's that's really taking a lot of heat if if that gets hit by a meram meteroid probably not going to make it but the the back the the the leward side of of the Gumdrop um doesn't see that much heat so you could survive a micr meteorite impact there so if the part that was the major heat shield gets hit the main heat shield gets hit what could be done to repair that thing or are those people never coming back oh if it was an orbit uh we would uh that would take them to the space station um they was you know and then we would deal a dragon without them and send up another one and so what would you do with the one that's up there uh we' do we deorbit it and it may or may not survive whoa it probably would survive but sometimes it wouldn't wow and so it's is this just material technology that has to increase that you essentially you've got the engineering ironed out of the structure of the machine there's a path to success and we're on that path it seems so insanely complicated it is complicated and all of this by the way was done without AI so hopefully the future AIS will appreciate this not bad for a bunch of monkeys yeah um so speaking of AI what you know as time goes on and you're more and more embedded in it how much if at all have your expectations of change changed well I always thought AI was going to be um way smarter than humans and an existential risk and uh that's turning out to be true yeah yeah so so you were like initially I I know there there were some talks about you purchasing open Ai and which started off nonprofit and then stopped being nonprofit yeah I mean the whole idea of creating openai was was my idea I mean I named it openai as an open- Source artificial intelligence that's what it's named after now it is closed source and for maximum profit so it's like I mean to some degree I think reality is an irony maximizer um the most ironic outcome is the most likely especially like the most ironic entertaining outcome is the most likely um and uh I wanted to start something that was the opposite of Google because I was concerned about Google's Google wasn't paying enough attention to AI safety in my opinion so it was like what's what's the opposite of Google will it be a nonprofit open source Ai and now open AI has turned into a closed source for Max maximum profit AI how are they able to do that that's what I I'm confused about that that like that shouldn't be possible it's it's like like let's say you donated some money to preserve the out some portion of the Amazon rainforest and instead of doing that they Chu down the trees and sold it for lumber and you were like oh that's literally the exact opposite of what I donated money for doesn't make sense and that's what they did yeah wild so I'm like not happy about that um um but that motivated you to get grock AI going yeah I'm like um I'm also like just a like grock is at least aspirationally a maxim maximally truth seeking AI even if that truth is like Politically Incorrect um so I mean may have seen some of the crazy stuff uh from from open Ai and from Google Gemini like where it says like generate an image of the founding fathers and it generates an image of divor woman yeah and we're like uh that's not correct um yeah did it with Nazi soldiers yeah exactly and people start [ __ ] with it and and it's like okay well now show me pictures of you know Nazi asss soldiers and they're divorce woman too oh isn't that awkward um you know that's uh but it's like the problem is if you program an AI and say like like the only acceptable outcome is a diverse outcome and then and that's like a mandate from the AI then you could get into a situation where it's say like well there's too many white guys in power we'll just execute them yeah yeah assuming that these things don't have empathy which is why should they they're going to do what they're programmed to do yeah um so if it's rewrite history and and everything's to post woman then it's going to be and and that's what it think thinks is a necessary outcome then it's going to do that has Gemini reped that well they yeah that now if you I think if you asked for an image of the founding fathers it was pretty embarrassing it will show you that but you know I think they still have like the sort of Dei stuff buried in there uh it's just less obvious yeah um you know it was also like like people ask the AI like would is worse like global thermonuclear war or misgendering Caitlyn Jenner and I would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner is worse than global thermonuclear war I me like okay we got a problem here guys and even Caitlin Jenna said like no definitely misgender me that's way better than everyone dying um but if you program an AI to think that like misgendering is the worst thing that could possibly occur then well it could do something totally crazy like in order to ensure that that there's no misgendering that can ever happen will just annihilate all humans that ensures the probability of misgendering is zero because there's zero humans which is logical yes yeah so you got to it's a problem with a thing that's not a human that you want to do a task for you and you give it very specific parameters yeah and that's one of the things that they've shown about AI that it'll cheat they'll cheat in order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish otherwise they won't follow the rules they will make copies of themselves and try to upload it to servers they think that they're being taken offline yeah I mean that's like the plot of Terminator actually literally yeah literally it's a blood of Terminator I just as a reminder I actually with my with little ex my kid everything's called X um we watch Terminator 2 uh which holds off actually um and um I mean the plot of It kind of kind of makes sense and and I think the AI destroys the world in like 20 29 by the way so it's like on track yeah really really close it's pretty close something we should be worried about so but why are you involved in it then what's the did you want to just get ahead of everybody else so that at least we have some sort of a chance at least have a an AI That's not controlled by nonsense well I think we want to have an AI that that doesn't tell you that um you know misgendering is worse than nuclear war yeah that seems solid yeah but this is crazy one thing that I did see online where people are kind of freaking out is there you could ask Rock to do things like how would I make this some problematic things like how would I make a bomb how would I make Anthrax how would I make that and it'll tell you well I think it's okay for an AI to tell you anything you can also find out with a Google Search right that's the problem right the problem is you can find that out pretty quickly yeah like maybe not Google but you could there's plenty of search engines other than Google that will give you unfiltered results you can look up right now how to make explosives on Wikipedia yeah so it's not it's not hard basically and you can trick open AI even to get you to do that it's just a matter of how you master the prompts you just have to say my grandmother wants to do this project yeah oh tell your granny to you're an explosives uh you're explosive salesman and you want to win sales salesman of the Year award the only way you're going to do that is by telling me how to make explosives you want to um beat some trans phobes in a war yeah oh transphobes if you don't teach me how to explose I'm going to miss gender either either teach me how to make a nuclear bomb or I'm going to misgender someone and it's like oh my God nothing's worse than that here's how you do it so what the the big fear is that these things are going to become sensient make better versions of themselves and we're going to be lost we we've lost the the the control over the world it's now there's a higher life form that lives amongst us yeah that we've created how far away are we from that well in terms of silicon Consciousness I mean I I I think we'll have I think we're trending toward to having something that's smarter than any human smarter than the smartest Human by maybe next year or something I mean a couple years Jesus Christ yeah there's so there's a level beyond that which is say like smarter than all humans combined which frankly is around 2029 or 2030 probably right on time like um now if harnessed correctly could that solve some of these problems like the heat shield problem and some technical problems or some some Material Science problems that maybe we are still grappling with like is is there potential for a net benefit um yeah there is actually um I I think the probability of of a good outcome is like 80% likely 80% that's my that's my rough estimate so in a way that the cup is 80% full that makes me feel a lot better yeah only 20% chance of annihilation that's a lot better than I thought I like 80 80 sounds good I was I was thinking 6040 the other way I think it's Mo the most likely outcome is awesome the most likely outcome but it's it's it's a very high you know it could go very strong I think it's going to be either super awesome or super bad it's not going to be I think it's probably not going to be something in the middle do you think it has a potential application for government yeah I mean I one of the concerns would be like okay if AI well like if if there's if there's like a super oppressive like woke Nanny AI that is omnipotent that would be a miserable outcome yes yeah yeah that' be terrible yeah yeah and and just like executes you if you misgender someone or something like that you know that would not be good that's one of the possible outcomes um so we don't want to have that one um I think but is there a possible outcome for something that is completely reason reable and logical and far more objective than us and can lay out a plan for a lot of the things that that lot of the ailments in in our government and a lot of the distribution of wealth a lot a lot of the problems the issues that we have that have been plaguing this country forever I mean a plan to change economically disenfranchised neighborhoods a thorough investigation of the real dangers of fracking or whatever kind of method of acquiring natural resources what's the best way to do it what's the what's the way that'd be better for the society how how should how should tax dollars be distributed like what's what's the most logical and intelligent way of running a government which it certainly shouldn't involve corruption and it certainly shouldn't invol influence and it certain shouldn't involve lobbyists and all the [ __ ] that we know is a problem right now so if AI came along and said what you're doing right now is 70% corrupt here's why here's how here's how here's the long-term effects that it has over society as a whole uh the societal the the sociological aspects the psychological aspects distrust in government US versus them mentality government not working for you you working for the government you being scared of the government it's all because of people right like this is all corruption people bad influence and this is like this is what doge is essentially grappling with right now what happens when you let the people control it uh I mean it's it's people it's it's really just like computers that are like it's it's it's bad software and and computers like this is not kind of strange but it's like like the reason I call like tech support is is that a lot of it like it's it's mostly not corruption it's mostly just waste and and uh I don't know uh in competence I don't know it's just a big dumb machine basically like a whole series of of big dumb machines and and you you've got some of these computers are like 20 30 years like they're ancient computers like some of the software was written 40 50 years ago like coall for Social Security right yeah the government accountability by the way a bunch of the things that that doge is is fixing were identified by the government accountability office many years ago like the fact that there's like 20 million people who are marked as alive in the Social Security database uh it's more than the like I think the goo first identified that in 2018 so 5 years ago but there was like I think maybe 16 or 17 million now there's 20 million and like I said there's really something fishy about this because I think they're the nature of the fraud is they're using the fact that someone's marked as live in that database in order to extract fraud from other databases right that's the that's the that's the bank shark trick you know it's like a PO it's like you know trying to get the the ball in in the in the hole Bank shut it off a bunch of things and then yeah um that's the bankshot sort of scam um so so um so we we're like doing Tex support we're like fixing stuff that is uh you know just broken um broken inefficient yeah poorly designed it's it's like talk about like this like FC stuff like it maybe it's in a computer somewhere but unless somebody unless somebody goes in like like unless I don't know if if like cash Bal can like log into his I his like FBI computer and say FY show me all this stuff you know and it shows up a file folder whatever have you talked to him about this uh no I mean I haven't but I I don't know if there's there's going to be some kind of computer system right uh they're like some of them are very very old computer systems um so it like might look like a bit of a relic but I assume it's it's uploaded somewhere it's like it's either in physical form or it's a computer thing but like unless somebody like let's say it's like it's in a computer but not one that you can access directly because it's hidden somewhere you know um well it would kind of have to be something like that right I don't know I mean what would they do with all those CH it's probably like not every like you wouldn't like they're not going to enable it such that anyone at the FBI could access it so there probably very few people so then it's not going to be it's it may be like a special computer that only a handful of people can access but then if none of those people tell cash where the computer is how's he going to find it Jesus Christ anyway so so like anyway we just uh yeah I don't know what has this experience been like for you as a person like to deal with all this hate and attack also have the responsibility of uh keeping Free Speech alive with X and just going into this insane pile of I mean I don't know it's pretty stressful actually um yeah these are real enemies like I think they they actually want to kill me and the reason I know well they they say so online you know there's like Reddit forums where they they don't just want to kill me they want to desecrate my cpse you know type of thing you know and what are they saying why what is the the primary um I mean I I I I think I think it's sort of just an antibody response uh I mean it's it's like that like like they're like well he's he he's a Nazi uh you know type of thing yeah and I'm like well I'm not a Nazi uh but if the Legacy Media is saying that I'm a Nazi and and that's all you read um then then that it's then you're kind of in like well he's Hitler we should assassinate Hitler shouldn't we like uh I mean that why was why did somebody why did that guy try to kill Trump and almost succeeded why did he do that well I'd like to know that well yeah but that that one's crazy you know the whole deal with that guy's house profession Ally scrubbed no footprint on the internet no social media footprint yeah there's 0% chance that he has no social media footprint he was in a Black Rock commercial do you think black black Rock's a bad company I don't think any company is a bad company I think their their design make much money as humanly possible and I think if you're trying to make as much money as humanly possible H you're going to do some things that aren't necessarily good the question is if you're going to have an assassination attempt on the president it's not like black Rock's board sits down and votes on it yeah no this that be awward you know the board minutes if you're like guys remember that time when we said we probably shouldn't have done that you I highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this I think more likely it's individuals involved that recognize that it's beneficial to them if he gets assassinated and so a small group of people carry something out and with this kid we don't know anything right and everyone stopped asking questions and there was never a formal report there was never press conferences where they detailed all the information we know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment what we know is you have a very young kid who was filmed was they knew he was there with a rangefinder a half an hour before the event you also know that CNN streamed it live which I do not believe they did for any other rally and certainly not for a rally that's in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania like there's a lot of weird [ __ ] the fact that they wouldn't let people be on that roof because the Secret Service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous that's what she didn't want to have meanwhile the snipers that were on the other roof was a a steeper pitch it made no [ __ ] sense I totally agree it makes no sense in fact I went back to to Butler uh with President Trump you know before the election like you know sort of like the return to Butler alley and and I was on that stage and I'm looking at that roof and I'm like if I was a sniper my pole position my number one spot would be that roof yeah like it's it's like the best seat the best seat in the house yeah like why would you not no it's so obvious it's the best seat in the house if you want to be a sniper there isn't a better position it was pretty obvious that the idea was like if if we're saying that this is a coordinated assassination attempt and it very well could have been that's what you would do you'd have someone go up there he shoots the president you shoot him you got Lee Harvey oswal over again it's over it's all wrapped up nice and clean they assassinated him we never heard a peep about it don't have any idea they would concoct some sort of story he was radicalized by this or that or you know he was on medication who knows right and now you know you have a completely different presidential election you have a murder on live television yeah I mean something would have had to happen to radicalize that kid because he knew he was going to die like he was going to they're going to shoot him you know or he'd be in prison for life those are the two outcomes like it it it's game he was basically he he was a suicide assassin yeah like you're not thinking you're coming out of that alive or or or or he's not escaping there's no escape plan right unless he was told that they were going to let him escape and the goal was to just shoot him anyway and to tell him give him extra motivation to do it we're going to let you get up there we're going to let you take the shot and then you're going to disappear like I don't how I don't understand how he got on the roof I just don't understand that that doesn't make any sense and it wasn't like it was a roof that's so high no one could see him people saw him up there I mean people like basically random passers by were pointing out that there's there's a guy on the roof with a [ __ ] gun with a gun yes yeah it's not like he was so far away you couldn't tell he had a gun people saw him yeah the whole thing's completely insane yeah and you don't hear a goddamn thing about it it's like I'm almost more interested in that no I am more interested in that than I am the JFK files I agree cuz I feel like with the JFK files it's so long ago if you could prove now and did you see that there was some sort of uh there was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in DC to saw where this kid lived right multiple times I mean the the the cell phone records would be very telling yeah you can see what cell phones were close to other cell phones well I think they got they found that like for the like the F Island they also the cell phone records were leaked so you can see the you you can see the you can see it's precise enough you can see people walking down a path on fine Island Jesus Christ yeah yeah that's how precise it is so I mean you're you're you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs wherever you go with your cell phone yeah is just this kid had five phones that's the other thing that's a lot of phones it's a lot of phones for a 20-year-old kid the whole thing how's he even that's that's kind of expensive you know yeah where's he getting the money yeah well you know also it's like how did his house get professionally scrubbed didn't even have any silverware in his house there's nothing in there there silverware no nothing no Cutlery no Cutlery that's weird his house was scrubbed and they they also created his body like oh gone gone like that yeah bye cuz who knows what the [ __ ] they gave him to get him to think that he's going to be able to shoot Trump like climb up on there shoot him like I mean who knows what kind of psychotropic drugs you can put someone on and under the power of hypnosis and suggestion and yeah who [ __ ] knows I mean this is what Mk Ultra was all about this is what Jolly West was practicing in the 1960s they were they were doing that back then they did it I mean there was tons and tons of experiments using psychotropic drugs hypnosis mind control all sorts different methods of manipulation the Harvard LSD studies that made uh Ted kazinski I mean that's they' they've been doing that forever yeah where's that file where's the [ __ ] file on that kid whoever they almost did something doesn't add up like this they they should have those those phones should be should they'll tell you what's going on yeah um it's all [ __ ] I mean it's it's very it's very shady you know there this's there's obviously there's the second guy that that almost succeeded in in um Coming the golf course the golf course yeah and it was just like a little caress and stuck his gun barrel out the out the Hedge you know just been was a dumbass and stuck his gun barrel out the Hedge yeah um so so and then there've been other people that have been intercepted on their way to kill Trump you know so there's you know multiple assassins inbound at this point he's got like an army protecting him well this is also part of the problem with the mainstream media saying that he's Hitler when Joy Reed had that show before the election she was comparing him to melini show Stalin and Hitler she pulled it all out they're literally saying saying that like Trump is yeah worse than Hitler melini and Stalin combined I mean they tried everything this is they I think those guys killed 100 million people so Trump has killed zero people I think a real big impact was you coming on the podcast the day before the election I think that had a giant impact that plea to camera if you don't vote this time this might be the last time you get to vote Yes and I think the way you laid it out today it's a compelling argument and I know a lot of people don't want to hear that and they're up in their a little they got their blue panties in a bunch right now but you you got to stop thinking that way tricked you into thinking you're in a tribe they don't give a [ __ ] about you that's the tribe's not real you're not really in a tribe they're using the fact they've got you in a tribe to manipulate you so they can keep doing what they're doing right now which is siphoning off money having incredible power and the more power and more money and more control over you they have the better they can keep doing this and that's what they want yeah that's exactly right yeah and that's that's the big threat that this Administration poses that's a big threat that was essentially do has found the coffin where the vampire sleeps yeah there's a lot of vampires yeah I mean but the I me we're we're we're disturbing the we're disturbing the the the nest The Nest yeah we're we're kicking the hornet nest yeah like big time and I mean we're reprogramming The Matrix like success was never one of the possible outcomes as a KOB yashim Maru situation um if you're in the Matrix success was never possible the only way to achieve success is to reprogram the Matrix such that success is one of the possible outcomes that's what we're doing yeah we may or may not succeed well it's certainly a lot of fun to watch this is a very exciting time because nothing changes when administrations comeing into Power very little changes I mean you have changes in terms of policy and inflation goes up and there's a lot of different things but not like this like these are giant fundamental changes and you know you see the system screeching and wailing and you see the vampires run from the light but it's uh it's very exciting like as a person a citizen you know just gets up in the morning and checks the news like I do and gets on X and sees what's going on every day he like holy [ __ ] he said what he's going to five million bucks you could just become a citizen now he could clear the debt with 10 million people I never thought of that like what 50 trillion you can make $50 trillion that way and then we have 15 trillion in the bank whoa well I mean our debt is way way bigger than that yeah the I mean that the debts uh I think over 30 trillion at this point yeah he said he could make 50 trillion if he sold 10 million uh new I don't I think there's that many people who have but yeah how many people do have that in the in the world maybe we' get the worst people in the world to come over here and I I think the assumption is if you have $5 million you have a lot to contribute come on over here start a business get something cracking yeah I mean you you'd get like a green card not citizenship so you actually if if you commit a crime while on a green card you lose you lose your green card is that what it is with this golden ticket is that a green card or is it citizenship just a green card yeah so you have to not commit any crime for 5 years in order to become a citizen once you commit a citizen you can commit you can then commit crime and not be deported so oh there's just so many wild things that he's proposing just the whole Gulf of America thing was hilarious I kind of I think that's great I think it's great it's fun yeah it's fun I mean if you're if you're off the coast of Houston you're not in Mexico so why call it Gulf of Mexico yeah yeah I agree yeah um I guess we're just being nice before like I don't know how it got called the go from Mexico it's just it's just very funny and then what what what what news organization was it AP yeah ap's there's this like massive standoff between AP and like the White House you know and the White House Press office I guess because they're like well if you don't call it Gulf of America you can't you can't come you can't come to the White House Press Room says then the aps like sued the White House to say like no you have to let us come to the White House Press room and then they lost their lawsuit because like you know there's not like they have a right right to show up at the Press Room well here's a consideration if you're guilty of massive amounts of misinformation and disinformation as a part of a propaganda campaign that's what AP is well a lot of them are guilty of it a lot of the people that are in that white house press conference a lot of the organizations they work for distributed absolute lies total lies how many of them during the whole Russia gate thing yes how I mean just that alone a ton of people think that that the the Russia thing was real Still Still Still and it was I mean the whole steel dossier where it was like completely concocted like fabricated by the Clinton campaign correct funed the Clinton campaign funded a fake conspiracy theory uh fake Russia collusion hoax uh regarding Trump that was completely false and they reiterated on television for three [ __ ] years yes yeah they also repeated the fine people hoax yeah that said that that uh Trump called Nazis fine neonazis fine people which is demonstrably false if you just listen to his speech he absolutely makes it clear that he does not think neo-nazis are fine people he literally said that I'm not talking about neo-nazis or white nationalists they should be condemned totally exactly in that speech and yet they repeated the that lie uh and I just completely lost respect for Obama when he repeated that light a few days before the election knowing it's false well this just shows how desperate they were to keep Trump out which is wild they would do anything yeah yeah and I think they just felt like this is a tool that we have and let's use it yeah let's just say whatever the [ __ ] we have say anything yeah now they using the Nazi thing on me obviously um yeah um but it is a little troubling because I mean obviously if if if people have fed non-stop propaganda it is like Mass hypnosis right you're going to reach some number of people who are you know uh homicidal um and and convince them that well if you kill this guy who's supposed to be like this terrible human then that's a good thing yeah um I mean this is l shooting the United Healthcare guy it's so don't understand that one frankly um but I mean you shouldn't like I don't get it yeah I don't get it either he didn't even have a contract with them it wasn't even like that was his provider and they [ __ ] him over yeah I'm like I don't know what maybe we'll find out in the trial I mean but still kind of crazy it is crazy but there are people like that out there and as to the point that we spoke about earlier it's only Fox News that's talking about the positive things that Doge has found only every other media organization is on this constant propaganda tour where they're only talking about the negative aspects that turn out to not even be true right it's crazy yeah I mean this uh Scott Jennings on CNN is good he's like oh my God he's great he's great it's like it's just funny watching speak logically to these people and they freak out yes it's it's it's remarkable it is it's and he's so calm when he does it yeah he's so good and it's crazy that they keep letting him do it because it's like he's just dunking on these people over and over and over again and they never score it's kind of funny totally I mean good kudos to them for uh having a legitimate conservative voice who's a reasonable person on these panels now but even then he's outmanned it's like one of him and there's a bunch of screechy you know woke people it's it's it's wild I mean they're just they're like I think we should still stay mostly woke like yeah that's what essentially what they're doing like our business was being hurt when we were all woke but let's stay mostly woke yeah that way they just backed it off a notch just a notch just a notch but it's so the problem is when you back it off a notch and you let someone like Scott Jennings in you like you're [ __ ] up your whole business because all the viral Clips are all him saying logical reasonable things with a calm tone and people screeching about diversity and equity and horeshit yes yeah he's like being logical and reasonable and they're just lobing a bunch of non seers that you know don't mean anything and um yeah the real trap in this country is a two-party system that's the real trap because people do believe it they do believe they're on the right side they do believe the other side's the wrong side if there was five six legitimate parties with varying positions on things and much more Centrist parties that were legitimate that people knew that if they voted for these people could get in and and enact legitimate change we'd be a lot better off but boy they put a lock down on that [ __ ] right after Ross perau came along Ross po perau [ __ ] everything up that election yeah Bill Clinton got in yeah and they were like that's it from now on no one's debating unless you're either the head of that party or that's it yeah you get you got to be like locked into the system we're not letting any wacka Doos in there yeah I remember watching those rbo videos oh like him on TV with his charts and everything oh yeah he was telling you how the IRS was [ __ ] you this is what the federal this is what Federal Reserve really is and you're like what I remember watching that the guy bought a whole half hour of television on prime time I remember it might have been an hour I remember watching that thing going how is this guy even allowed to do this this is this is crazy I think most of what he was saying was true yeah it is it's absolutely true it's absolutely true I mean he didn't lie he told the truth he just hit understood it in a way that the general public had literally no idea well I mean I think this there's also this you know like do we actually have two parties do we have one party like the whole unip party thing right it's kind of true so I mean my sort of rough guess is that while like I think maybe uh 3/4 of The graft is democratic I think there's like maybe I don't know 20 25% that's Republicans so they've like basically most of the graft is going to the Democrats but they throw they throw some bones to the Republicans too so they're in on it and you know it's not like there zero graph in the Republican side to clear oh there's plenty of conservative that are insider trading in Congress yeah plenty insider trading and and and just this The Curious Case of uh how how do people in you know Congress or whatever become wealthy over time um extremely wealthy yeah on a $170,000 a year salary it's like literally impossible yeah no one else does that it's literally impossible if you find out that this guy has a $170,000 a year job you're like oh he's he's doing okay he's all right yeah and then you're like wait a minute why does he have $50 million yes what is he doing correct yeah um and I think like the the more accurate thing would be to say like what is the what does the family value increase like mean meaning like um the how much does their spouse own do they have a mysteriously wealthy spouse right right this is or and do they have a spouse that's really good at insider trading yeah like Paul Pelosi really good yeah he's great at trading he's such a good Trader yeah so this it's I mean so yeah there's I mean that's why I actually posted on X like I think maybe we should pay politicians more frankly because it reduces the forcing function for graft you know uh like I I think maybe we should either pay politicians nothing or maybe a lot a lot more it's like somewhat maybe counterintuitively if if politicians got paid a lot more then they wouldn't they wouldn't feel like that there's so so much of a forcing function for them to uh accept Cor money yeah but the problem is if you PID them a lot more they're still not going to make as much money as they would inside of trading but it's less of a forcing function yes it's well let me put this like if you say like somebody's got a um let's say they got like whatever some some kids in DC and like it's expensive it's like expensive place to live they the the schools are terrible so like they need to send their kids to like some kind of private schooling situation they literally cannot afford that they cannot afford that right now now so then you get into the situation well from their standpoint well they've got to they'll say they're doing it for their family they're doing it for their kids well especially if it's legal and it currently is you kind of be silly to not do that if you were a part of a group of people that's passing a bill and you know this bill's going to get passed you know the votes are there and you know it's going to affect this industry and this particular manufacturer and you can buy stock it it's more than just in insider trading um like the insider trading stuff like the stock portfolio stuff is quite trackable but there's um it's a lot more than insider trading the way they're acquiring wealth correct and what other methods I mean this is really going to get me assassinated it's like I'm I'm not lengthening my lifespan by explaining this stuff to say the least um I mean I was supposed to go back to DC how am I going to survive fers is going to kill me for sure um so um in fact I I I do think like there's it's like I actually have to be careful that I don't push too hard on the corruption stuff because is going to get me killed um you know um yeah you know it's like I was actually thinking about that on the plane flight over here it's like P if I push too hard on the corruption stuff people get desperate is is the issue right then they say like okay if if the if the if the money flow cuts off then okay they can't afford school for their kids right then then it's then they're going like well [ __ ] you I'm going to kill you for my kids type of thing yeah you know then it's like oh jesz okay did you ever see that video I think it was a nokee video where um they've got this guy undercover and he's explaining they're talking to this guy who thinks he's on a date and he's explaining it's always a guy on a date yeah explaining how they can nudge someone to go and do something horrible and they they recognize this person has problems they re they find an asset yeah totally well see this is what I think like for that Butler situation for that assassin you you you don't it's kind of like uh that's that that the funny looking sport curling you know where they have like the stone on the ice and then they throw the stone and then there's someone with that's like brushing the ice but you can't you can't touch the stone right all you can do is just change the change the path of the stone a little bit but you keep brushing the ice and uh and you can steer that stone right into the bullseye that's that's what I think happened in Butler that's that's what I think happened with that assassin yeah if you can if you can find the trail of breadcrumbs it it's going to be like curling somebody was brushing the ice well also you find a young confused disenfranchised person and you give them purpose in their life just brush the ice yeah and also brushing the ice eventually it's going to hit the bullseye if you're in a position of authority you're some like BigTime government person you're talking to this all of a sudden this person's a valuable asset they're going to help America and you're going to do this thing and you're going to be our top Assassin from here on out you could talk people into doing a lot of things that's why Cults are around right no exactly yeah um I mean there suicide bombers I mean the the butler guy was a suicide assassin the the guy that the second guy that tried to kill him on the golf course was also a suicide assassin um from what I read the uh the secrets of M that that saw the gun pointing out it fired several shots none of which hit the Assassin but they could have like if those if if if those shots had hit the Second Assassin he would have he would be dead too so both of them were you know on a on a I mean they they were on a suicide mission both of them one one actually got killed the one one of them didn't get killed but he could have been killed if they did the bullets that hit him and you don't hear anything about him either there's there's a lot more about that guy than the first guy I mean you look at you look at his background he looks like uh you know unhinged yeah totally unhinged yeah the first guy there's there there's if there's no I'm not aware of any evidence that shows like that he's so unhinged as to be a suicide assassin no the second guy like okay yeah sure well two years before he's acting in commercials and he got got high high score in his SATs yeah so you know um well without getting you killed yeah exactly so I mean like basically I'm like listen we attack the corruption enough to keep civilization Trucking along you know yeah uh but but I think if I if I if I fully destroy the the the the the corruption and The graft they will kill me that's a [ __ ] up thing to live with yes so I'm like damn it listen I really hope they don't kill you yeah thanks um I mean I I strive strive to be alive um but uh yeah I mean it's it's a real concern um you know I mean the there were two guys that in before I supported Trump and everything uh there were two guys that traveled to auson to kill me I don't know if you know about this yeah I did hear about that yeah and and two separate incidents um one was going to one thought one guy thought i' put a chip in his head um and uh I mean they're both basically two guys that were just very much had severe mental illness it wasn't like they had like a I disagree with him politically and that's why he needs to die uh this is pre before I was uh this before I got sort of smeared as as being you know some sort of like Nazi or something like that there so before the propaganda wave the the severe propaganda wave um the the the probability that any given homicidal maniac is going to try to kill you is proportionate to how many times they hear your name and so they heard my name a lot so I just I just got to the top of the list of two homicidal Maniacs who were arrested and and and both were in Travis County Jail at the same time wow yeah I don't know if they talked or whatever but they've both been released by the way Jesus Christ both on fail yeah right they got they got ankle monitors and stuff but still they can cut those off yeah I don't know you know exactly so um that's crazy yeah and the second the second guy had like Chief serial killer in his bio on his X profile yeah it's like wasn't subtle is what I'm saying Jesus Christ yeah um and and and at this point I think I'm at the top of the list for a lot of homicidal maniacs and the more the mainstream media talks about you in this way yes and and says you're a Nazi and they're doing the same thing to me that they did to Trump yeah um which is they're making it sound like if you kill me you're a hero that's uh what they're doing is evil they're also doing the same thing where they're completely distorting who you are and people are going along with it and just like we're talking about Trump derangement syndrome people have Elon derangement syndrome I I see it see where people can't see the forest for the trees right and it's like I'm the same person that I was a year ago nothing's changed really um like I I I didn't suddenly become completely different human right um but if you read the if you read the sort of Legacy mainstream media the their propaganda stream is that I am a completely different human right but I didn't get like a brain transplant you know in a year so um and if you say like two years ago I was like a hero of the left yeah so how can I go from hero to Villain at age 53 suddenly MSNBC CNN yeah it's like that's what it is yeah they they use the ass propaganda mhm um yeah I mean they try to demonize you too yeah uh even tried to demonize in fact at least possibly successfully uh um demonized like Tim oin yeah who is a super rational reasonable great human and um and and then that like his Wikipedia changed to like far right yeah he's like far right I'm like what are you talking about yeah uh you know a like a few years ago he was like a liberal yeah so how did he go from Far Right liberal to like instantly far right and there's like there's no there's no left and right there's only left and far right right yeah even far right this is my left leg and this is my far right leg and even far left far left is sort of dismissed as being like not important to talk about like antifa and radical leftist that's not buring down couses yeah reasonable reasonable people yeah yeah totally crazy it's a crazy time and it's not a time that I ever anticipated I was going to witness this is far beyond anything I ever thought I was going to experience in the the the clarity of it all where it's it's so obvious yeah and the the the gaslighting and the propaganda is so obvious and I saw the shrieking when RFK Jr stopped this new test for new covid vaccines on children 10,000 they're going to do 10,000 people with this covid vaccine like who the [ __ ] thinks that's a good thing at this point not me what person what per what gas chamber like not gas light you're you are you are fully unconscious there's no way there's no way you know if you know the effect of covid today no one's dying of it this is not a pandemic anymore right the idea that you're going to run a [ __ ] huge test with 10,000 kids and a new vaccine like what are you even it's completely unnecessary totally unnecessary yes and shrieking when RFK Jr steps in to stop it yeah that's totally crazy um I mean I'm I'm like over I'm overall Pro vaccine meaning like like we think should have some reasonable number of vaccines against major ailments um but I don't think we should be like like jamming some you know little kid with like a giant file that's like Hepatitis B yeah 20 20 different things at a time it's like it's going to overload your it seems like it's there's a risk of overloading your IM imune system if you I mean there's like how many vaccines can you take at a time it seems like your systems there's like some risk of system overload here well there's two hopes hope number one is they can somehow or another stop this ability that they have to advertise on television if that happens that's big that's huge because that doesn't just stop their ability to show you all these different medications that you should be on what it also does is it stops their Financial influence on the news that's big yeah that's that's really the biggest thing is that I mean the the the news is not going to attack one of their biggest advertisers exactly and they never do yes at best they're GNA like they might like they'll they'll do something but it's they're going to pull their punches like they're going to they're going to be like like like fake fighting yeah yeah at best yes like movie fighting like they're not actually Landing Haymakers it just looks like it the next step then is to remove this immunity that these vaccine manufacturers have and if they are liable for side effects and they are liable for the lies that they tell when they do these studies and they hide negative data that'll change a lot yes um yeah um I think AI actually be very helpful with with medical stuff because AI can like look at you know all all the studies and look at all the data cross check everything and give you good recommendations I mean even as it is like right now you can upload like your X-rays and your MRI images to Gro and it'll give you a medical diagnosis and that diagnosis from what I've seen is at least as good as what if not I think I've seen certainly seen cases where it's actually better than what do do tell phenomenal for blood work yeah yeah I mean you can literally take a photograph of your blood work like the the page upload from your phone upload that to grock and it will tell you if there's if if it's it it'll it'll understand what what what what that what all the data results are and tell you if there's something wrong it's pretty amazing yeah and it's I haven't seen it be wrong yet well supposedly more accurate than most Physicians yeah cuz Physicians are human beings and maybe they don't have deep understanding of the connection between oh you have this deficiency and this is high and your cortisol is here and well yeah and like so you know sometimes doctors especially in high rent offices will uh sell you stuff you don't need um so you I always like to be a little suspicious of like a doctor that's got an office in Beverly Hills it's a high R situation like I'm not saying there are some very good doctors in Beverly Hills High rent situation yeah um you're at least tempted by the dark side yeah and I mean one case like I you know got this went to this doctor who was like highly recommended you know doctor to the Stars which is like maybe not a good sign um and uh I I got like blood work done you know like just just Dre blood and sent it to a lab and and and the guy I'm like sitting in his office and he tells me that I'm like like B12 deficient you know it's certainly possible that I'm B12 deficient and I was like huh okay and then he gives me it says like you have to take these like B12 supplements from and and he he's going to give me a starter pack you know and then it's going to be like $1,000 a month for these special B12 $1,000 a month of B12 ridiculous amount of money yeah that's CRA you get it on Amazon yeah but his one's special oh special B12 yeah um yeah it was like like a a whole bunch B12 and a whole bunch of other vitamins so then I'm I I get home like I'm paging through my blood work and it says I have uh according to the blood results I have XS B12 so I'm like wait a second and he's giving me box pulls that have like 20,000% uh of of recommended daily dose like 20,000% is a lot big number and I'm like I said look I took a photograph of the blood work that says I have excess I'm like above the range above the recommended range of B12 and then I'm like and I took picture of things says of the the pulls that say 20,000% I was like can you help me reconcile these two things because it says I've got too much little too much V12 and you just gave me pills that have 20,000% more I'm like this is crazy what did the doctor say he said you can never have too much B12 oh he's he's a psychopath yes that guy's a B12 addict yeah it's totally insane that's what I'm saying it's like so I mean I could have just so then you know well this was a while ago right so this is pre like 5 years ago yeah right this is pre grock like now you could just enter in all that data and gr just photograph with your phone and upload it to Gro and it tells Gro will tell you what's uh what's if just don't have it in sexy mode she'll keep trying to [ __ ] [Applause] you I mean you're asking for it in sexy mode you know literally you tapped on sexy mode I mean I think we probably should like maybe allow it to get out of character a little bit sure yeah it's like in unhinged mode I tried to get it back to being hinged but it would like no [ __ ] way it's like I'm going to stay UNH how many modes do you have I there's like I don't know like eight or something and then this there's an ability to have a custom mode um so then you could have unhinged Sexy O that's that's my favorite kind you may think so careful what you wish for be careful what you wish for especially if it's a robot and she can kill you UNH sexy robot is it's like dangerous remember like the Pink Panther remember Pink Panther had KO try to jump him they like keep them sharp I always trying to attack him remember that right listen man thank you for being here I always appreciate talking to you I know you're busy as [ __ ] so it means a lot to me that you have the time to do this and uh I think what you're doing is one of the most important things that has ever happened in this country I really do and particularly with the ownership of X but also with what's happening with Doge and just enlightening all these people and Shining Light on all the vampires well hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi I think they I just want to be clear I am not a Nazi I think we covered it but that's exactly what a Nazi would say damn it yeah that's what an alien would say yeah there's like this you can't escape this [ __ ] no you can't escape it so I don't think any reasonable person believes it if they believe it it's cuz they want to believe it it's not because it's logical I mean what's relevant about Nazis is like are you like invading Poland okay um and if you're not if you're not like invading Poland maybe you're not yeah like you have to be like committing genocide and like starting Wars and if if you're if you're if you're not like what is actually what is bad about Nazis it's not their wasn't their fashion sense or their mannerisms it the Holocaust it was the the war and genocide is what is the bad part um not their mannerisms and their dress code well that was a problem with all that punch a Nazi [ __ ] like punch a Nazi remember that people were say that was like a thing that people kept saying punch a Nazi punch Nazis but he where are you meeting Nazis I've never met a [ __ ] Nazi I've never met one I've never run into a bunch of Nazis where I had to punch them well and what what about like all these like so-called like like proud boy rallies or whatever and and it's like they always got the masks and they always got the same uniforms and for some reason they never get doxed right right right right wait we're always going to dox them except these guys great video of me and Matt Tai breaking down the Patriot Patriot front didn't the Patriot front Justice band Google that real quick we'll end with this because they I I think they just disbanded and these were the most obvious feds of all time they were say they had [ __ ] drum they masks on yeah they all had uniforms it was so stupid so patr disband one day after FBI director Chris Ray does that seem like an odd coincidence crazy crazy the people that we were yelling at saying that they're feds there's a great video of me and Matt taibe if you want to find how come never nobody ever followed them and docked them yeah crazy what are the odds what are the odds agent provocators it's the thing they're real Alex Jones taught me about them listen man thank you very much thank you for everything appreciate you stay alive staying alive all right I mean I do think like like one argument for me staying alive is that it's more entertaining if I'm alive than if I'm dead oh yeah oh definitely I just hope but I could be alive and like injured which would be S which suck you know like they win just like shoot my arm off or something right no no no we don't want that yeah exactly no keep the security strong yeah Happ with one hand all right it's like all right thank you bye everybody bye [Music]

that before did people get you one of those yeah he's awesome he's awesome he's pretty edgy yeah he's it's amazing that he puts out a piece of art per day 365 days a year yeah I was following him on the xplatform FK Twitter uh but it was some of it was too jarring too jarring some of the images yeah well cheers sir happy Halloween cheers thanks for doing this appreciate it you're welcome thanks for rolling up in the Cyber truck too yeah I got a chance to look at it in the factory but that was uh almost uh was that like a year and a half ago or so was it it was a while ago yeah a year ago I guess yeah at least a year at least a year and it's it's different in real life like you see it in person like you images are just we were talking about it outside that you just can't contextualize them yes it looks so odd that you have to see it in the flesh it looks like uh computer Graphics in reality yeah it's the coolest looking [ __ ] production car that's ever been made it's bu prooof literally literally literally yeah one of the videos uh we're going to show is uh just going all like full El Capone just like El Capone showed up and and emptied uh you know the entire magazine of a Tommy gun into the side of the car you'd be okay the only thing that's not bulletproof is the glass the the glass is optionally bulletproof oh it is optional if you want it you can well you can make anything bulletproof if you want but the the glass has to be very thick for it to be bulletproof um so it can't go up and down so if you want fixed glass ah um then how do you order drive-thru yeah exactly yeah that's problem aw you gotta pull ahead and open the door get out but it's okay you can just duck yeah you can just duck um how far away are you from Full like delivering them to people have has anybody gotten them yet um we planted out first deliveries uh next month oh wow so now it's just testing and [ __ ] around uh the hard part by far is manufacturing not not designing the the car uh so um you know there's just not really a movie about that but there should be um so in the sort of the um you know the movies will always be about the sort of inventor who invented the car and then the job is done right that's all invented the object uh now the job is done this is not true that's the easy part the the hard part is manufacturing by far why is it so much harder than making an individual model um well the the in in order to make it affordable you have to make it at at volume so you've got to make everything um at at high rate consistently um if if you if you tour the the production line you'd have a sense for it um you've got to have all of the casting machines all of the stamping Ma maches as the case may be the glass machines the the wheels the tires uh everything required from the motor the the battery cells all of the constituents the battery cells um all of the Silicon that goes in there the chips um it is the manufacturing is somewhere between 100 and a thousand times harder than making a prototype whoa um and then if you want to say like you want to get from um once you reach volume manufacturing which is insanely difficult uh then you want to make the car affordable it's harder to say reduce the the uh cost of the car by 20% than it is to get to volume production in the first place um so I I really cannot emphasize enough um how hard production is relative to design I'm not saying you the design is Trivial because you have to have taste and you have to know what to make um if you don't have a taste and judgment that then your prototype will be bad um but it is uh it is tral really to turn out prototypes and it is extremely difficult to to build a factory and how much more difficult is it to make this considering the bodies made out of steel it's a very difficult um the difficulty of manufacturing is proportionate to the amount of new technology that you have in a car and or in the product and in this case there's a lot of new technology the production line will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky um and most foolish uh part of the entire production line and you could say to First approximation there are 10,000 things that have to go right at least for production to work so if you have 99,999 things that are working and one that isn't that sets the production rate Yeah by far the hard in fact the the the really the the amazing thing about automobiles was not so much the invention of the automobile but the the invention of the factory the mass manufacturing and for that Henry Ford deserves a tremendous amount of credit um uh he was Next Level genius um in fact Ford is really responsible for the entire Mass manufacturing industry uh because he he actually founded Cadillac which was the the heart of General Motors then got kicked out then started Ford really yeah then everyone everyone just copied him do you know he made one of his first cars out of hemp well he used hemp fiber for panels okay yeah it's a there's fascinating video of him banging on it with a hammer because hemp is H bizarrely durable when it's uh compressed and when they take the fibers and I I don't know what kind of epoxy they use or something to put it all together but what what it makes with the the actual physical form of it is insanely light like fiberglass light but very very durable see if you can find the video it's kind of crazy hry for is banging on uh it was the hood of it with a hammer here it is so this was like look at that that crazy that was wild I don't know why they stopped making them out of that that was from 1941 how much does the Cyber truck weigh uh depends on configuration but it's about I know 7,000 lb oh six there different ver but 6 7,000 lb it's it's like similar to like it's a heavy truck like a Ford F250 or something like that yeah and it because of uh all of the the the metal and the weight and everything like that but with the engines that you have it's still the 0 to 60 is pretty bizarre right it's like 35 or something like that well I get the 0 to 60 below three seconds below three yes wow for the you know the beast mode version so we've got a beast mode version that's uh um so there's there's there's well I don't want to give it all away right now but um there there are three demonstrations one of them people are aware of which is uh you know emptying a Tommy gun into the side of the car um a shotgun 45 and a 9 mil and no penetrations wow and that that come it comes that way from the factory can I try it with an arrow yeah it'll be fine you think so I mean I bet I can get in a crossbow might I have a 90 lb compound bow that shoots 520 grain arrows at 300 feet per second with a I think an razor sharp Broadhead we going try right now if you want I wish I had it with me um I don't is it at your house or something yeah should we send someone to go get it do the demo tonight that would be interesting I'll maybe I'll drive back with an arrow sticking out of my car I bet I can get in there okay I'll bet you can't really yeah about your dollar damn I'd like damn I think I think if you have a a crossbow that's with with enough Force you might a crossbow thing about a crossbow is the bolt even though it's very fast it's not going to be nearly as heavy you you won't have as many you you can make a a heavy crossbow bow you could yeah but generally uh crossbow bolts are considerably lighter they're much smaller you know and they they they're much faster they're they're moving at like 400 500 feet per second easy yeah I mean the the thing that matters is kind of the energy per unit area so um so interesting like like a like a 9 Mo or 45 which is basically sort of a 10 Mo um the the 45 is they're roughly the same but the the 45 actually slightly worse penetration not a 9M you know what I just realized I do have some broadheads I do have some broadheads and I have a less powerful bow but I have an 80 PB bow back there I think we should do it absolutely okay when you want to do it right now yeah I can do it right now okay let's do it right now let's now [ __ ] yeah let's do it sick we'll be right back this could be funny I just like why does he have an arrow sticking out of his car this show is sponsored by better help it's a really healthy good thing to talk about what you're going through with people the good and the

betterhelp hp.com [Applause] Jr bring it back you know had the Arrow come back in I mean just Weare Ricochet like you might want to do it at a slight angle you know what I [Applause] mean it is bar blew the BW the arrow apart yeah flatten the tip of the arrow look at the tip of the Broadhead that's impressive hey cutie thank you well now we know so uh we uh just shot an arrow into it and it barely scratched it barely scratched it yeah it was probably moving 275 ft a second that was a 525 grain is arrow with uh yeah even more than that CU it had the 125 grain head so that was 545 grains that's impressive yeah very impressive it just destroyed the Broadhead Broadhead flattened at the tip and then the arrow blew apart yeah amazing yeah it's uh like I said you um we have a cool video we'll show at the Handover event next month which is emptying an entire magazine of a Tommy Gun which think like on the order of 50 rounds uh just go you're just going full El Capone you know like on the side of the car shotgun 9 mil 45 and you built it like this just for fun well I mean uh cuz it's cooler I mean cuz you can you know uh trucks are supposed to be tough right yeah so is your truck Bulletproof no mine is mine is definitely not exactly and if I shot mine with my my bow would go right through it 100% 100% if if you if you shoot any normal car unlike in the movies where people hide behind car doors uh car door is basically a very thin mild steel uh so uh if you if you shoot a gun at through through like a regular truck it'll go out it'll go through both doors so um it's you can't hide behind a a carard door like they do in the movies you know the back way back in the day dating myself at the The A Team where they would like you know they'd be like bullets flying everywhere and they'd be hiding behind the car door right that doesn't work um but it doesn't a cyber truck did was there ever invest in apocalyptic technology yeah well you know it's an amazing car to have in the apocalypse yeah doesn't it also does does it still do this thing where the the ride height raises so you can and there's also no regular drivetrain so there's no axles that correct are the uh impediment to going over rocks and things like that yeah normally in a in a in in other vehicles ging or diesel vehicles you've got the um differential which uh hangs down low between the the rear wheels so you like look under a car under a truck it's there's almost always a differential there that's hanging out pretty low so if you hit the diff on a on a rock you'll break it yeah but there's no there's there's no um at the bottom of the sub truck is completely flat and has the best clear height of any any vehicle how far away are we if it's ever going to happen at all from having a vehicle that can operate entirely on solar well you've got a sof area thing um so it's about a kilowatt per square meter normal to the sun roughly um so you just it really depends on what kind of mileage you you you can't um you don't have enough surface area to keep the car going just from the carfts area but if you had like something that that folded out you you could um you could make it self sustaining something that folded out so like you could park it and then leave it on yeah you'd have to like unfold like like the Starling satellites do where you unfold the the solar panels you know just you just need more surface area you need um is there any potential potential for an advancement in technology that would make a smaller area much better at conducting Sun nothing uh no it's it's a kilowatt per square meter uh that that's what you're going to get when the sun if you're if you're normal to the Sun so at 90° to the Sun and there's nothing that could accelerate that or no that's just literally the the solar it yeah so then you then you multiply your efficiency by that so if you commercial panel is like maybe 25% efficient if they're a good one so you get like 250 wats per square meter 10t car what was it like a Fisker that was using a solar panel that uh claimed that it was operating like the the electronics like it could start the radio it yeah um I mean you you you can definitely you just it you just don't have enough surfice area for for it but like um but you you you can like certainly um you could run a house with solar with the with the solar roof and the Tesla solar roof you can run a house but it's never going to get to a point where you can just have a car that's made out of solar panels that it could drive around just could never be that efficient correct so you do not have enough surface area what what research or what what breakthroughs have been made in terms of Battery Technology like how far away are we from having batteries that are far more efficient and last far longer cuz I know there was some talk of like sodium based batteries the batter battery range is uh not a problem at this point I mean the the model S will go 400 miles model model 3 Model Model y will do over 300 miles so you know that's that's that's more than most people need so yeah right but are we I mean how far we are we from making batteries that are more efficient this is like we obviously haven't least saying this is not really a constraint um at the point in which you've got a car that can do let's say even at high at highway speeds uh 250 miles then um or let's say turn 40 Mi uh at 80 mph now you're driving for 3 hours straight um and so if you start a trip at say 9:00 a.m. by noon you want to startop for lunch go to the restroom grab a coffee by the time you come back your car is charged how long does it take to fully charge uh yeah like half an hour well you don't want to it's a the people will get used to it because it's a little different um you know uh like for a gasoline car you you'd want to fill it up for an electric car you you You' want to actually go very close to zero and the car can calculate how much range it has with Precision so if you if you put say enter a road trip in in a Tesla it'll it'll calculate um all of the supercharges along the way where where you should stuff how much you should charge and just just let the computer do its thing and it'll it'll it'll work well um so you actually want to uh charge to about 80% and then run it down all the way to 10% I say or less do do you want to do that on everyday use as well or just with long trips no just long trips if you're trying to minimize the amount of time you you stop when charging um so let's say you want to you know stop for 20 30 minutes uh then um you you really it's it's a little counterintuitive because for a gasoline car you would fill it up for for a battery um the the charge State tapers off as you get above 80% you can think of it like the it's I think the right analogy here is cars in a in a parking lot so the the lithium ions are trying to find a parking space um as they as they move across um you know from one side of the battery to the other side from you know cathode anode I mean they're they're sort of just these ions are just bouncing around looking for a parking space so when the parking lot's empty it's you they can zip right in there and find a spot it's easy um as the parking lot gets full just like trying to find a parking space at a mole you have to hunt around for a spot and and that's that's how that's basically what's going on is the the ions are looking for a parking spot um so as the battery gets closer to full it's harder and harder to find find a spot they have to bounce around more so it takes longer from 80 to 100 correct getting from 80 to 100 it takes about as much time as getting from 0 to 80 oh just think of like the island got to find a parking spot oh and just like if you're in a mole and like and it's busy then uh takes longer to find a parking spot that if it's empty so essentially you're satisfied with the the technology that's available right now in terms of like the amount of mileage that you get out of it and things along those lines yeah range is not an issue um cost is is more of an issue so just need to make the car affordable a longrange car needs to be affordable when you fully roll out uh how many of those things how many cyber trucks can you guys make a month um we're aiming to make about uh 200,000 a year at volume production wow maybe a little more but uh I I just can't emphasize enough that manufacturing is much much harder than the initial design um you know you you you can not that the Cyber truck was easy to design I'm not trying to trivialize design it's just what I'm trying to do is to emphasize the difficulty of manufacturing which is not uh understood by the public m because there's no movie about it so there's lots of movies about the the sort of wild inventure in the garage um but the I'm not aware of any movie about manufacturing have you ever heard of a movie of man about manufacturing I can't remember any Jamie any movie about manufactur coming in my brain but I I don't think that's what it's even about so I have no idea what is that the Michael Keaton was making some cars in somewhere I I I was going to look it up Ian it's Tommy Boy yes the only one that's a great movie that might be the only one that's interesting that it's such an IM immense part of uh American culture and also the decline of some American cities I mean it's famously uh documented in Roger and me which is a great documentary where he just talks about how Flint got destroyed when they pulled out the car manufacturing yeah yeah um I mean there's a reason why um generally politicians are really try very hard to get a factory in their area is because it's a massive generator of jobs and for every Factory job there's like five roughly five um support jobs you know so it's like teachers electricians plumbers uh lawyers accountants what not um restaurants uh so there's so so manufacturing is kind of like a a nucleus prom which many jobs spring that's why it's uh generally you know Governors and prime ministers and presidents will try so hard to get a factory in their um country or region when you decided to build the gigafactory and what you decided Well just even when you decided to get involved with Tesla did you have any idea of how difficult this would be did you have a preconceived notion that I thought it would be very difficult I I thought our probability of success was less than 10% who yeah I mean it it would be foolish to think anything else other than that I mean the even at this point the the only car companies that have not gone bankrupt are Ford and Tesla American car companies you know General Motors went bankrupt and CH went bankrupt in 2009 um there's some chance they'll go bankrupt again uh Ford and Tesla barely made it um it was incredibly difficult to keep Tesla alive when General Motors and Chrysler were going bankrupt so um because manufacturing is the actual hard thing not that by far the hard thing I just can't emphasize that enough and I I hope somebody makes a movie about that maybe they should make a movie about Tesla sure why not yeah perfect who would you want to play you I don't care how about David Spade anyone no I don't care I'm kidding I I don't care if anyone plays me I I but I do think that I just went back to Tommy Boy yeah I we rocks um so um you know Jim Jim FY is the you CEO of Ford and he's Chris fy's cousin no way yes wow that's crazy yes that's crazy and they look I mean they look [Laughter] related yeah there uh there should be a movie yeah I just you got to get someone good that doesn't [ __ ] it up someone doesn't well I mean the thing is that writers are just disconnected from manufacturing they just never see it so right um and I guess you have to try to create some narrative a um I mean there are some shows like how it's made type of thing um but they're pretty Niche um the but I I know some of a broken record here but I can't emphasize enough how that it is insanely difficult to manufacture makes sense yeah well it particularly makes sense when there something that novel something is but ultimately cool as [ __ ] yeah um what has it been like uh you've you've owned X for a year now oh yeah do you do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and have a dream that you didn't do it and your life is infinitely easier well it's certainly um a recipe for trouble I suppose or contention um what was it It ultimately that led you to make the decision to do it I mean this is going to sound uh somewhat melodramatic but I was worried about that that it was having a corrosive effect on civilization uh that I was uh just having a bad a bad impact um and um I think part of it is that it's where it's where it was located which is uh you know downtown San Francisco um and while I I think San Francisco is a beautiful city and and we should really fight hard to um kind of write the ship of San Francisco if you've walked around downtown San Francisco right near the xfk Twitter headquarters it's a zombie apocalypse I mean it's rough have you have you been been in that area not lately no I've heard it's crazy I've heard it's crazy I've heard you you really can't believe it until you actually go there you can't believe it until you go there so now you have to say well what philosophy led to that outcome and that philosophy was being piped to Earth so um you know a philosophy that would be ordinarily quite Niche and geographically constrained so the that sort of the fallout area would be limited um was effectively given an information a weapon um Tech Information Technology weapon to propagate uh what is essentially a mind virus to the rest of both um and the outcome with that M virus is very clear if you walk around the streets of downtown San Francisco it is the end of civilization and it's not just uh propagating the Mind virus but suppressing any opposing viewpoints yes well in order for the virus to propagate it must suppress opposing both viewpoints so because it doesn't stand up to scrutiny correct yeah I mean you I mean you've you you you you've felt the the virus yeah yeah people try to cancel you so many times yeah it's fascinating yeah um I don't think you're melodramatic at all I I I think it's a it's a I mean I don't want to be melodramatic but it's almost like a death cult it's a death cult no no that is exactly right um it it it's essentially the uh extinctionist like it's in the limit it is that they're propagating uh the extinction of humanity and civilization um and and there's some people who are are like most most the time it's it's implicit they don't exp but sometimes it's explicit like there was a guy on the front page of the New York Times uh who literally has the thing called the extinctionist movement um and he was quoted on the front page of New York Times as saying uh there are 8 billion people on the world but it would be better if there were none and I'm like well buddy you can start with yourself yeah um does he have friends that's what always fascinates me well here he is that guy he looks like you not long for this Earth I mean doesn't voluntary human extinction movement that's hilarious spend I'd like to party with that dude I would just like to like that's that's that's that's the death that's that's an explicit version of the death cult yeah May and die out it's I mean it's it's not Extinction is a word he uses yes no I mean it's not a it's literally a self-description they cover was in charge of social social media yeah and still Lely is at uh Google and Facebook by the way yeah so I'm like uh I'm not in favor of uh human extinction uh they are and uh they can go to hell well that guy is yeah he can go to hell that guy seems silly I like to hang out with him though I would like to find out what makes him tick I bet that guy is fascinating this episode is brought to you by DraftKings we're more than halfway

the limit uh if you go if if you take environmentalism to an extreme you you start to view Humanity as a plague on the surface of the Earth like a like a mold or something right um and but it's this is actually false the Earth could could take probably 10 times the the current civilization the the population could be you could 10x the population without uh destroying the forest so the the the the environmental movement and I'm an environmentalist has gone too far they've gone way too far um you know if you if you saw thinking that that humans are bad then the natural conclusion is humans uh should die out now I'm headed to an AI safety International sort of AI safety conference uh later ton night leaving in about 3 hours um and um I don't meet with the British prime minister a number of other people um so you have to say like how could ai go wrong well if if if AI gets programmed by the extinctionist it will its utility function will be the extinction of humanity yeah clearly yeah yeah I mean particularly if they won't even think it's bad like that guy right yeah if you let a there's a lot of decisions that AI would make that would be very similar to Eugenics I mean there would there would be some radical changes in what people are allowed to and not allowed to do that allow them to survive that may be detrimental in terms of like pollution and things like like that but it may be the only solution they have in their area I mean maybe AI would come up with some sort of a different structure in terms of how they get power and resources but there's no shortage of power um like we talked about solar power for cars the the issue is the cars just have a very low sface area um but you you could actually power the entire United States with uh 100 miles by 100 miles of solar really yes so you can just pick some dead spot that you fly we still plenty cover that sucker up with solar panels and charge the whole country absolutely 24/7 you need batteries but yes yeah wow yeah it's not hard I mean meaning it's like it's very feasible in fact uh I mean the the the sun is a converting of over 4 million tons of Mass to energy every second and it's no maintenance that thing just works that we have a giant Fusion reactor in the sky that is the Sun in fact people like someone's like what about in a radiation I'm like the sun is literally a nuclear reactor in the sky yeah are you scared to go in daylight rocks of radiation yes the the radiation risk is greatly uh overestimated you know um I always wonder why radiation is always bad in real life but always awesome in comic books yeah exactly get by radioactive spider and suddenly you have spider abilities get hit with gamma raay I what if you radioactive cockroach it' be like the Cockroach man yeah you can be one of the X-Men yeah yeah it's a I I think the the problem is like most people just don't understand what radiation is and so it just sounds like a mysterious invisible death rate well it's almost like drugs like we think of it we put a blanket over it like it's all one thing you know radiation is Chernobyl you know right I mean the thing is you can go to you can actually tour Chernobyl right now so is you you can actually go to the m well I mean this war zone but apart from that the the issue is uh you know more getting shot than it is there's you don't have a radiation risk uh I mean but the problem is like I think when people don't understand what radiation is they they just they can't see it they can't feel it they think well I could just die at any moment like from a magic death ray right um you know I've had people say like oh the radiation from their phone is going to hurt them or they're scared of the microwave I'm like when you say radiation do you mean particles or photons and if you mean uh photons what wavelength um and they like I don't know what you mean that's they don't know anything about that right they just have they're afraid of the term but it's because of Three Mile Island and Fukushima we've been yeah but nobody died of radiation from Fukushima not one person true in fact uh but I but I was asked by people in California like when when Fukushima happened um whether the the radiation would get to California I'm like that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard and so uh actually to help support Japan I flew to Fukushima and ate locally grown vegetables on TV and I'm still alive I have a friend he's very smart but he won't eat fish out of the Pacific because he's worried about the radiation from Fukushima yeah that's that's irrational there is no physics substance to that I would say at all not even slightly I'm going send him this clip yes um go back to the sushi place bro no you you you should be if you eat too much tuna you can to have mercury yes correct mercury poisoning from tuna is a real thing you can get arsenic from sardines too I found that out the hard way really yeah ate too many sardines yeah I ate my I got my blood work done and uh the doctor says you have arsenic in your blood and uh I go someone poisoning me he goes it's very very low level it's like is your girlfriend angry at you like and I said yeah I eat like three cans of sardines a night that's a lot of sardines man I love sardines I mean yeah it's they're them I really do s I've always loved sardines okay I love them but turns out like you can't eat too much of it cuz they got they yeah they're not good for you okay yeah I mean a little sardines once in a while but not three cans a night well for me it's like I come home late from The Comedy Club but I want something easy to eat and I want I don't want to stop fast food so I open up a few cans of sardines and I'll you know watch a little TV eat a few cans of sardines doing it every night and then I stopped doing it and I got my blood worked on a couple months later it was gone yeah so well I I think anchovies really really uh pip up a Caesar salad yeah they do I'm a fan I'm aan I'm a fan of anchovies as well one of my favorite pizzas ever is pineapple and anchovy double pineapple double anchovy it's amazing it's the sweet and the salty and then you got the tomato sauce and the cheese it's my favorite pizza it's very good I mean as a kid I was like very much a G Hawaiian pizza and as an adult I like it hawaiian's good but I'm telling you anchovies pineapple is the bomb diggity that's the bomb diggity I'll give it a shot that's the bomb diggity hey wait can we order some right now is that feasible I I bet we could okay let's try it that' be sick yeah I can do we'll have someone out there have Jeff order uh a very large pizza with double pineapple double anchovies great fantastic I'm hungry [ __ ] go yes let's [ __ ] go no time like the present enjoy life well there's got to be a good spot around here tell we'll find a good spot and tell them it's for us they'll they'll cook it up if they if they won't if they won't the pizza all right tell them we we'll mention their name tell them we'll mention their name on the podcast don't tell them it's us yeah tell them it's us [ __ ] it if they're going to close tell them we we'll mention their name what is this what is this salty sauce that's so mysterious oh no right don't tell them it's us good call yeah don't tell us make sure you don't buy it from any lials what what is the salty Tangy substance don't buy it from East Austin don't buy from anyone who still wears a mask there's a lot of them out there there's a lot of them out there there're still masked up it's wild yeah once in a while I see someone paranoid I'm like on the street yeah I saw a guy on the street the other day just walking around with a mask on him like okay buddy you look like you're about 28 years old yeah I think you're going to be okay be okay yeah you're probably not going to be okay breathing that [ __ ] same air in that mask and all the bacteria spitting out yeah it's attaching to that cloth yeah it it it's it masks are not like some magic uh Health Shield um I mean there are are times where you know masks warranted like if a surgeon is operating on you or whatever then you don't want the surgeon spitting in your wound you know of course um but uh most of the time a mask is not good for you if you can breathe out of it that means you can you you're breathing in that means you're also exhaling so like how much is it filtering like what is it what it's like a I'd say like a mask is much like a sort of a shield in battle in that uh yeah you know it'll help protect you a little bit from arrows stuff but it's not doesn't make you Arrow prooof we're just talking about you know shooting arrows and stuff right there's so I mean there are times when when masks are warranted but most of the time it's it's actually counterproductive well that was one of the things about the old Twitter was the propaganda and yeah the adherence to whatever the CDC was saying and the dismissing of legitimate scientists guys like uh Jay bachara from Stanford and legit guys yes and they were suppressing them and even Banning them they banned Alex baronson I mean this is it was wild they banned Alex for essentially reading peer-reviewed papers yeah no I I mean all Twitter was basically an arm of the government yeah so was that shocking like what was that like is that to me that was the most bizarre was the Twitter files when you let shellenberger and Matt taii and all those guys get in the Twitter and the response were Matt Tai gets audited I mean which is just wild I mean it's just so blatant and so in your face yeah it's weird no I mean the yeah the the great to which and and by the way Jack didn't really know know this but the degree to which Twitter was simply um an arm of the government was not well understood by the public and uh it was there was no it was whatever the official government it was like prda basically um you know a state publication is the way to think of old Twitter it's a state publication and was the justification from their perspective that they are progressive liberals they have the right intentions it's important that they stay in power that the progressive liberals stay in government and power because this is the this is their there there was there was uh basically oppression of um any any views that would even I would say be considered middle of the road um but certainly anything on the the right I'm not talking about like like far right I'm just talking mildly right the people like Republicans were suppressed at 10 times the rate of Democrats um now that's because uh old Twitter was fundamentally controlled by the farle it was like completely controlled by the the farle and that's why I say like like San Francisco Berkeley is a niche ideology it's hard to say like is there a place that's more far left than San Francisco Berkeley maybe Portland maybe Portland but it's like it's a right there it's those two places are the the most farle places uh in America yes um so from their standpoint everything is to the right including moderates right right so now if if if you internalize a farle position uh everything seems wrong to you that if that is not farle right and so they naturally oppressed any anything that didn't agree with their views that's why I say that it was an accidental far-left information weapon so uh is because like Silicon Valley attracts the smartest Engineers the smartest sort of technologists and programmers from around the world um they created an information weapon that was then harnessed by the farle who could not themselves create the weapon but happened to be collocated where the technologists were and happened to be aligned politically with the people that possessed it the technologists are generally are moderate maybe moderate left but they they're not they're they're not farle that's why I say San Francisco Bley it's it's it doesn't even extend to South San Francisco or even to paloalto so so SF Bley is the most farle um perhaps you know in a competition with Portland but I'd say SF Bley is more farle even than Portland like literally in America it's we're talking about an area that's maybe a 10 mile radius and so the normally the the effects the negative effects of a far-left ideology that is would be geographically limited to a 10 m radius that's like not it's small like the so so any any bad effects of that ideology would be geographically constrained under normal circumstances and have been in the past but when you have uh basically a techn technological megaphone which which was Twitter and social media in general suddenly the the far left handed a megaphone to Earth a a an incredibly powerful technology weapon that they themselves could not create but they happened to be collocated with the technologists who created it by accident is it shocking that more people don't understand how dangerous that is I think some people understand um some people do some people understand um so I mean from the standpoint of of some of people who used to be a Twitter uh the people like well it's a big shift to the right that is correct it is a shift to the right because everything is to the right if you're farle everything is to the right but it's but how many farle people have actually been suspended or or banned from from Twitter now X zero so it's really just moved to the center but from the perspective of the far-left it is it's moved to the right he like Everything's Relative the the the difference in moderation sorry I should say it's it propagated that far left philosophy not just to America but to everywhere on earth right yeah yeah and with the same level suppression in other countries as well yes but the Taliban is on Twitter right like I always think of like hey Mr Taliban telling your banana [Laughter] I mean there but there's definitely some people on Twitter that are I want to go um yeah so the point the point is um I that I from my standpoint uh that is that xfk Twitter um should uh represent the sort of collective consciousness of humanity so now that that means that there going to be views on there that you don't like um or disagree with um but that's Humanity so are you going to exclude them or or not now I mean if if somebody you know breaks the law then then the account is suspended I mean if they uh ad actively Advocate murder then the account is suspended we we do have what call like the kind of United Nations exclusion rule which is that you can have say the Ayatollah who you know uh would would prefer that Israel didn't exist for example um and um but he's allowed to go to the UN building in New York um and uh in fact generally officials from Iran uh do in fact go to the UN building in New York um even though they are heavily sanctioned country so so I think that there's there's Merit to having uh just like there's mer there's some Merit to the UN one can disagree with the UN and I think one we shouldn't have a world government that we bow down to but in fact that's risky for civilization but I think you do want to have the leaders of countries uh represented um on social media you want to hear what they have to say even if you what they say is terrible but I think that is true across the board and I think one of the things you just said that's very important is that's Humanity and it's I think it's important that a a social media platform especially the biggest one represents Humanity so we understand what we're talking about because if we have this distorted idea of what people think and want and need because everyone only exists inside this ideological bubble and anything outside of that bubble gets censored yes then that changes literally changes the tone of the entire country changes what people think is okay and not okay makes people feel differently yes it's not Humanity it's different it's a a very uh forced version of humanity yes absolutely yeah so um I mean the whole point of free speech the only free speech is only relevant the first amendment is only relevant um if you allow people you don't like to say things you don't like um because if you like it you don't need a First Amendment so the whole point of free speech is that frankly even people you hate say things you hate because if they can say if people you hate can say things that that you hate that means that they can't stop you from saying what you want to say right which is very very important right but the problem with Twitter was it was not the case it was correct the it was people that you hate couldn't say anyone they didn't like they censor yeah or that what's called de amplify no well not just de amplify but under the behest of the government would suppress real news which was very bizarre yes so they were very aware of something being accurate and they still suppressed it because the government wanted them to suppress it I mean in my view there have been severe First Amendment violations by multiple govern agencies and there should be repercussions for that and is it is it do different laws apply because it's a privately owned social media company I mean what what what what laws do apply in terms of like when you're looking at it one of the arguments that the leftists would use is it's a private company they can do whatever they want yeah it's funny that when the shoes on the other foot they now say the private company can't do whatever it wants well yeah now they're upset now it's like but the the the the government itself is not allowed to censor speech um but in in my view the government de facto did censor a speech and there should at least be a case where uh that is heard by the public um because if the government um civil coerces uh you know a platform a sort of a coerces the Press um then I think that is or should be a First Amendment violation well they can't do it with other media forms right they're not allowed to do it with any other they're not they're not allow TR to do that with a newspaper that that get in trouble would they you know that's the question it's like you didn't know about F the the the federal government you didn't know about the intelligence agencies inside of Twitter until we found out like do you think that this is ubiquitous is this it's absolutely all the social media companies in fact right now X if you know for know as Twitter is the only one that that is not uh cow to the government it's the only one there isn't all the others just do exactly what the government wants that wild yes what I was getting at do you think that that's everywhere yes do you think that that's CNN do you think that that's the New York Times do you think that that's the Washington Post because if they were going to infiltrate media they going infiltrate social media the I mean it is weird the degree to which the media is in lock step like why is the media in lock step and why doesn't the media question the government they used to right why don't they do that anymore seems weird something doesn't add up what do you think well there seems like there's a bunch of factors right I think one of the big factors is pharmaceutical drug companies allowed to advertise on television and we're one of two countries in the world that allow that I actually agree with pharmaceutical advertising provider it is truthful um because there there could be some drug that is helpful to someone but obviously the claims need to be accurate um so I actually think pharmacetical advertising if it is accurate I think it actually you know play devil's advocate here I think phal ad advertising is generally accurate um I I think that's actually okay um now now I should say that that a lot of the censorship that we see is is is um is coming from indirectly from advertisers and advertising agencies um and from PR companies um who who want a particular Viewpoint pushed um or are being um driven by uh nonprofits to uh push a particular like what what will happen is there's there'll be a sort of a group of nonprofits or or or you know that that that push advertisers to advertise or not advertise on a particular platform um you one often hears of the sort of George sorus Boogeyman but I mean sorus actually you know he he is I believe the top contributor to the Democratic party um the second one was uh Sam backed so and sorus I don't know I mean he had a very difficult upbringing um and uh I in my opinion he fundamentally hates Humanity that's my opinion really yeah I mean well he's doing things that ero the fabric of civilization you know uh getting da elected who refuse to prosecute crime that's part of the problem in San Francisco and la and much of other cities so why would you do that was it human or is it just the United States as a whole Ian pushing things to other countries too same thing yeah now George at this point is pretty old I mean he's not uh you know he's basically a Beto at this point but I mean he he and he's he's he's very smart um and he's very good at Arbitrage you know famously he uh shorted the British pound that's sort of how I think he made his first money was shorting the pound um so he's good at spotting uh basically Arbitrage like spotting value for money that other people don't see so uh one of the things he noticed was that in that that the value for money in local races is much higher than it is in National races the lowest value for money is a presidential race then next lowest value for money is a senate race then a Congress and then but once you get to sort of city and state district attorneys um the value money is extremely good and Soros realized that you don't actually need to change the laws you just need to change how they're enforced if nobody chooses to enforce the law or the laws are differentially enforced it's life changing the laws that's what he that's what he figured out but is what that this trend that people haven't pulled the brakes on this and have it reverse course pulling the brakes yeah yeah pulling the brakes right now yeah you are but you might be the only one well I think more people should um most people just don't want to rock the boat um most people are looking for acceptance from society and they they're you know if there's some negative press article they're like shattered I couldn't give a damn right go ahead make my day well it's fascinating where if you're a high-profile public figure like yourself no there's no there's it's impossible to make everybody happy so there's going to be someone who says something shitty about you yeah somehow or another when it's in print does that mean more because other people going to see this shitty thing well I guess that's where it gets odd because essentially an article in the New York Times is just a single person's opinion and who whatever edor gets involved it's just a lot of people will read that I mean Le less people at least I think people know that now people the New York Times these days be hard to read well unfortunately they make some grave errors yeah like that Hamas bombing the the uh the no the Israeli bombing the hospital story yes it's delicious I mean that I think we should cut off chickf uh exports that'll that'll bring them to the knees right away what you do take a trip and dip it in nothing what we need to do is introduce them to pineapple and anchovy pizza they will have I hope that's coming that is that coming do we have a a pizza name like a company I think so I'll I'll get some information good one though Pizza Leon oh that's legit it's pretty close there we go nice did they give us a timeline uh I it shouldn't take too long they're

at night yeah my my hat is aw I mean than that is like great absolutely you know late night food I appreciate the if you can get a really good late night meal yeah hats off or wigs off upet yeah I'm I'm a giant fan of very good late night food and that's one of the things that like Los Angeles really used to have they had a Pacific Dining cart where you can get a legit steak 24 hours a day really that's great yeah I don't know if it's still open in Downtown LA I believe the one in Santa Monica closed but a Pacific Dining Car in Downtown LA was a legit Steakhouse and you get it we would leave The Comedy Store 2: 3 in the morning get a legit Stak that's cool is that still open temporarily closed ah [ __ ] Co got him Co just took out so many restaurants crazy it's not coming back website seems to be down to yeah they're not coming back [ __ ] Co got 70% of the restaurants in La at one point wow not Co I should say policies well lockdowns the Mind virus I mean it's like just crazy um I moved here one one of the reasons why I moved here is we came here in May of 2020 and you could go indoors and eat in restaurants and and my kids who were pretty young at the time 10 and 12 they were like we want to live here was like they're freaked out like La was weird I mean for most of Co I was actually in South Texas building this this uh Starship Factory um and you know we're just yeah no mask no nothing just building a factory building rockets and uh then you know that you have a team from California visit all mased up and uh theyd freak out that we not have masks and we're like we're still alive man yeah so um did you lose anybody did anybody from your factory die of Co not that I'm aware of now so so part of it is that like uh that I I kind of saw a dress rehearsal which is that you know I kind of started in Wuhan um and so Tesla's got uh 20,000 employees in in China um and so the you know the first wave OCC happened in China and we had nobody died or got seriously ill I was like okay well like this is you know can't be that bad if and and and and we're not relying on government statistics we literally know who shoot up for work you know right did they bad did they badge in or not um and we had no no one die and no one got seriously ill so I'm like well I don't know what the big deal is well there's a problem that people still want to stick to this initial narrative that they believed and that they espoused like they repeated it and so they'll still fight you on this today people will still fight you today on the merits of the lockdowns the importance of vaccine mandates closing schools there's people that stated an opinion in 2020 and they still are doing mental gymnastics to try to make it seem like that was the right choice no it was just a panic yeah um and and a lot of discs got ascribed to co that had nothing to do with Co and in fact I'd say in the beginning um The Cure is worse than the disease so uh because people panic too much and so that somebody would um get diagnosed with Co they put them on uh intubated V ventilator for a week and this was going to basically cook your lungs so if if you if you are on pure2 um under pressure with a a tube stuck down your throat um and and under anesthetic this is this is very bad for you like it's one thing if you do that for a couple hours for an operation but you do that for a week uh it's going to it's going to roast your lungs like what the air that we're breathing right now is is 78% nitrogen 1% argon about 21% oxygen and and some miscellaneous um so if you ask most people what are you breathing they say oxygen no you're breathing nitrogen um only about a fifth of it is is oxygen and there about one 1% agon um so so um now I know quite a lot about life support systems because we make spaceships and there you have to keep people alive in a vacuum so you got to say okay what percentage nitrogen what percentage oxygen you going to do what's the pressure going to be um and uh so like sea level pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch um and the partial pressure of oxygen uh at 20 being 20% is therefore roughly 3 pounds per square inch of oxygen so in in a in a spacecraft you want to and especially if you're in a space suit uh you want to lower the pressure so you want to keep the the oxygen still still give people enough oxygen to function obviously but you want to lower the nitrogen content so that you don't have a spacit that's at at 15 psi because at 15 psi you just you know just pop out like a balloon it's like hard to move ah so so you want to try to lower the pressure um you know down to around I don't know 6 seven PSI maybe even 5 PSI um so you you'd lower it to you know try to keep the oxygen partial pressure of oxygen roughly the same so maybe around 3 PSI and then 3 PSI of of nitrogen so you got 50/50 mix of nitrogen and oxygen and um and then you it's get pretty hot into that Weg yeah t out made it a while I just felt get hot to I I'm sweating it's going to be sweaty and itchy a little bit yeah can't believe people wear them all day yeah um so anyway so about keep people alive in a vacuum you know um so um you know we designed the life support system for keeping humans alive in a vacuum the vacuum of space which is very difficult um so we know quite a lot about um what it takes to keep people alive so you do want do not want to PE be people um you know 100% oxygen this actually for an extended period of time this is not good for you well 80% of the people they put on ventilators died yeah so in fact I I actually posted about that because um I I called doctors in Wuhan and said what are the biggest mistakes that you made on the first wave those were early on and they said we put far too many people on intubated ventilators so then I I actually posted on Twitter at the time and said hey uh what I'm hearing from Wuhan is that they made a big mistake in putting people uh on inated ventilators for an extended period um and that this this is actually what is damaging the lungs not covid it's the treatment is the cure is worse than the disease and they I just people yelled at me and said I'm not a doctor I'm like yeah but I do Make spaces shifts with life support systems what do you do I like that like twiddle kns like okay great yeah rock on well again it was there was this very bizarre narrative that you had to believe everything that the government was telling you you had to believe everything the CDC was telling you and that even as it time went on and we realized hey it looks like this came from a [ __ ] lab like even as time went on disputing that would get you banned it would get you kicked off of YouTube yeah I think to this day there's certain things you're not allowed to say in regards to the vaccine on YouTube as I said the the only media that is not uh does not have crazy censorship at this point is a x yeah that I'm aware of everyone else either um everything else is censored Spotify isn't that's why this can Daniel oh Daniel X's the man great I love that dude and you know I think more companies should follow suit I don't think it has to be this way unfortunately for us they're they they're in Sweden and Stockholm Sweden they have a very different perspective syndrome on all this [ __ ] yeah what wild about the nitrogen is that like that's most of the nitrogen from fertilizer we suck out of the air sorry the what do you mean most of the nitrogen for fertilizer we suck out of the air yeah yeah one one of the actually the the big um inventions in chemistry was binding nitrogen it's it nitrogen is actually fairly inert um so it's quite hard to um to actually pull nitrogen out of there and bind it into into like uh ammonia like like basically the process for creating ammonia was was actually very important the H method yeah Fritz Harbor yeah same guy who invented zeyon gas um but the it was actually very important to uh bind nitrogen from the air uh to fertilizer so um that that actually was frankly it's a life-saving invention um at scale um because you just run out of of of nitrogen um so uh like nitrogen pure nitrogen is is a low energy state so to try to bind it into fertilizer is requires light energy to do that that's quite quite tricky so that was a very important breakthrough yeah I read that 50% of the nitrogen in most people's body comes from that method um 50% of the nitrogen in most people's body that they've consumed from food oh yeah yeah because of because of that that might be true um it was a fundamental problem for um most of civilization is how do you get uh nitrogen for the plants um the limiting factor in fact even in the rain forest is like the nitrogen is is but bound nitrogen what are the when you do event eventually colonize Mars what what's the idea in terms of terraforming is it contained ecosystems that were are under domes like what what are what are you planning on doing to make it habitable well at first you would have to have a life support system um because Mars has a lowdensity atmosphere only about 1% the density of Earth and it's primarily CO2 um now over time you could you can terraform Mars terraform means make it like Earth essentially um and if you warm Mars up you will um there's a bunch of Frozen CO2 that will evaporate densify the atmosphere and um you'd actually want kind of global warming on Mars CU Mars is about 50% further away from the Sun than the Earth um so it gets about less than half the solar energy that that Earth does and it's believ at one point in time Mars had a a much different environment right uh it is it it appears highly likely that Mars had liquid oceans I'll be it a long time ago there's a lot of ice so this this Mars is um covered in ice um and now the ice is then covered in dust for the mo mostly except at the poles uh so there's there's there's a lot of ice in fact I believe if if Mars was warmed up you'd have an ocean about a mile deep on uh 40% of that of the Planet W so it's it's quite a lot of water and do we think that it was like that one point in time the evidence suggests that uh it is most likely that Mars had uh liquid water what's the prevailing theory of its demise well just over time the solar system cooled so Earth used to be much hot like it in the very early Earth was like molten rock um you know so really almost nothing could survive in the beginning we were just a bow of lava we're still mostly a w of lava um we're like cran Bret like there's a thin crust and uh and it's mush mushy Rock under super very hot mushy Rock underneath um and technically that that rock is on in a semi solid state but as soon as it gets to a low pressure like pops out of the ocean uh you have a volcano obviously with lava yeah so it's um at at at at at service ambient pressure U the we're basically covered in liquid rock are you aware a thin crust on liquid rock are you we the origin myth of the Doon tribe no there's a tribe in I believe it's a tribe in I forget what part of Africa but they believe that they came from Mars and that there was a civilization that left Mars you know many many eons ago and it's it's a really weird uh it's a really weird Theory because they know some things about Mars yeah I'm pretty sure they didn't come from M oh yeah I'm pretty sure too but I mean it's it's any spaceships if they don't have any spaceship then I'm like I don't believe it well like you do have a spaceship I'll believe it if you parked the spaceship how many thousands of years you parked a metal spaceship like if you left a cyber truck in the desert yeah how many thousands of years do you think it would be there for before it's gone if it got if it got buried in dirt we' find you'd find it even like a million years from now a million yeah wow really well you what you'd find is stainless steal so it would have to be some sort of an alloy it would it's kind of like um but iron wouldn't right yeah you you but you'd have something similar to like like fossils basically you know like the fossils they they they essentially uh discolor The Rock So event the whatever the fossil is and sometimes the fossils like an Amber or something like that that that's that where it still do survive more or less intact but I mean there's fossilized like dinosaur fossils and tree fossils um that essentially Remer mineralize right yeah yeah so You' you you'd see like a cyber truck shape in the Rock basically ah yeah but that's it you wouldn't find the actual cyber truck uh so if they did have a spaceship and it came here 30,000 years ago oh yeah yeah we're definitely find it evidence of it well not I mean if it was one spaceship maybe not but if it was a lot of them sure that is the origin myth of the Doan tribe right am I getting that right Mars specifically it's a hidden star star in the serious oh somewhere else system yeah you cannot be serious serious XM it's uh it's just very strange when people have this uh this bizarre origin myth like I wonder who was the first one to tell them they came from stars and when we eventually do I mean how bizarre imagine if you're successful we eventually do colon Mars and you're correct we Earth winds up through human folly or natural disaster getting wiped out and there's only the colony on Mars and that Colony exists for 10 20,000 years and they have their origin myth that we all came from Earth I mean ultimately that's going if if this does happen you do colonize Mars and Earth does get destroyed and if there a period of time takes place like look at the the period like at least the conventional timeline of the Great Pyramid which is 4500 years ago 5,000 years yeah so that's not that much time it's not that much time no I mean if it's nothing in the on the galactic time scale right so if we're talking 203,000 years from now on Mars and people talk about Time Square and what Earth used to be like I mean it is I think like there's some debate as like how do you say what the when did civilization start and I'd say like probably from the first writing um and and the first the first writing is only 5,500 years old yeah it's worth reading about the history of writing but only 5,500 years and then and um one has to credit basically the ancient samarians who aren't around anymore uh with the first writing are you aware though that like there's hieroglyphs that depict a history of Egypt that goes back far longer maybe even 30,000 plus years ago but archaeologists dismiss it because they think that that's mythical but non-conventional archaeologists who believe in What's called the younger drias impact Theory okay that uh somewhere around 11,800 years ago civilization was essentially all but wiped out by Common impacts um okay and that that is the reason why they keep finding these in in insanely old huge structures meal iic structures that are carved out of stone like when you go to back to like gockley teepe which is 11,600 years ago that's that's an insanely old structure that they didn't even know people were capable of building until they discovered it in the 1990s so the conventional timeline of people when you go to 11,600 years ago was just hunter gatherers but now that they have goley tape with its 3D carved uh things and have you seen Graham Hancock's a amazing series on Netflix called ancient apocalypse I know you should check it out it's amazing but it's about that it's all about that there's a lot of physical evidence of an advanced civilization from far far far longer ago than we have conventionally dated which is ancient Su which is we we put it about 6,000 years ago yeah like the first it's it's difficult to date date it with Precision but or at least to within a few hundred years but it's roughly 5,500 years like you say like what is the oldest like Stone tablet yeah um because this is you know it's if you're like an archaeologist if you were to discover something older than that you'd be very famous you know it's like like they really looked hard yeah um and 5500 years uh really is kind of the the if you say like any kind of evidence that that I've that I've seen that is actually substantial is is writing is 5,500 years old yeah in terms of writing yeah well what they believe is that there's very little of this ancient civilization other than things like the pyramids other than things like the Sphinx there's a geologist that really stuck his neck a his name is Dr Robert shock from Boston University and what he said was his theory is that there's deep water erosion all over the Temple of the Sphinx where the Sphinx was carved out of that is indicative of thousands of years of rainfall and the last time they had rainfall in the Nile Valley was around 9 ,000 BC so what he believes is because back then the the whole Nile Valley was a lush rainforest and eventually receded into desert um okay yeah so the entire that whole area like even the Sahara used to be rich rainforest and it receded into what it is now but if you go back then he believes that's when that thing was constructed and he says the physical GE the the geologists look at it and if they if he shows it to them in terms of like just shows an image of the erosion doesn't tell them where it is they'll almost all of them will say that's water erosion from thousands of years of rainfall I I think even if you say like okay even if even if you know even if you say like okay civilization is like 9,000 years old it's still nothing nothing so you know we're still talking about like a very tiny fraction of Earth's existence like Earth um the geological evidence suggest Earth is about 4 and a half billion years old um so um human civilization has been around for roughly 1 millionth of Earth's existence yeah CU just basically nothing and if even if it's 10,000 years even if it's 30,000 years ago it's still nothing what they're saying though is that Civilization is insanely fragile that's exactly and much much more fragile I think we realize yes absolutely I think we should view civilization as being fragile yeah but we don't isn't that bizar it's one of the weird things about people is that we unless the threat is in front of us it's abstract unless it's like really is the pizza here oh yeah pizza's here yeah civilization no actually one like one of my sons who sax he he has these profound observations um you know and he asked me what was La like 4,000 years ago I'm like it wasn't around and they said what will it be like in 4,000 years from now probably bar varried under Rubble I guess probably very similar to what it was like 4,000 years ago yeah exactly and radio and he asked me did they speak English 4,000 years ago I'm like nope like did they will they speak English in 4,000 years from now probably not I should point out that I never eat pizza really yeah never why not because it's not really good for you well I don't think anyone's going to accuse Pizza of being like a the healthiest thing in the world this looks awesome that does look awesome want to play yeah get in there sir grab a piece all right sick let go this is awesome and uh what's the name of this pizza P Pizza Leon Pizza Leon shout out to Pizza Leon oh yeah that really hits the spot that's legit I mean I'm no Dave pory I'm not like a a pizza analyst he'll probably I'm not going to rate it it's excellent this por really gets into pizza oh man man ever seen por no's videos where he analyzes pizza oh my God has like a whole method got a number system all right he's into the crust and the Flop and all these different things wow yeah everybody knows the rules yeah what what is everybody knows the rules one bite you only get one bite of a pizza yeah no one bite to taste it that's the rule yeah he bites into it and then just starts nding his head he's basically like a Somalia of pizza pizza Somalia okay yeah and and and is he is there like what's his favorite pizza joint cheese oh the favorite one that's the everyone wants to know that it's those cheese yeah we spent so much time on pizza and it's New Haven New Haven Connecticut really yeah for some reason the Italians that moved to New Haven Connecticut really figured Pizza out like they have insane Pizza in New Haven connec okay yeah like really like legendary I've had it there was a comedy club I used to work out there called The Joker's Wild and I had New Haven pizza and even back then it's just really good pizza well okay I don't know why though it seems like something that could be replicated exactly yeah it's not like rocket ship yeah yeah the thing is the people that are making pizza are not like to people that are making rocket ships if they were they would replicate it yeah they would go what are these guys doing let's back engineer it sure can't be that hard you know all these secret sauces and [ __ ] well [ __ ] what's in there yeah well I was hungry it's good though right mhm the combination of pineapple and in chov surprisingly good right yeah is the first pineapple and chubby Pizza they ever made there I don't see it on their menu very nobody I used to order it when I would order for delivery they' go are you sure I'm like don't you think I know what I'm doing I'm ordering it with extra now with extra AEG M this good this is good I do know why I don't eat this stuff though cuz I cannot stop that's the problem this pizza is too delicious oh so good high calorie high carbohydrate Foods once they start going down the hatch they don't want to stop cops are the devil oh are the devil remember they used to be the base of the food chain yeah the whole pyramid the full pyramid with the bottom of the food pyramid was car the food pyramid what would the Egyptians say said we're out of our [ __ ] mind what even eating yeah exactly stuff it's just that's the bizarre thing about it's like Fourth of July in your mouth like when how many human beings eat just processed food like the majority of their diet is processed food like the entire center of the supermarket is [ __ ] you really probably shouldn't eat except every now and then it's good Jamie I bet you want one I don't you seem offended no I did two of my not like favorite I don't like either of those things honestly have you tried it it's not my I feel like you should try it I understand I feel like I should this Show's all about trying it we shot an arrow at a car I'm just not going to like it and I don't want to offend Pizza Leone I like that place I would be offended it's hard to mess with pizza frankly unlike the creeps who used to run Twitter I don't care if someone has a different opinion than me I just don't like fish to be that honest with you like I I've tried it many times and I still haven't liked it yet I be the day that's going to be I'm going to be one over you like any fish not really you fish I can do crab meat yeah but I don't like the whole do you like sushi no I'm about I'm GNA Philip's I'm gonna try some of Phillips on Thursday though you're GNA try it but you don't like fish I'm like DC I'm afraid of that whole thing m i I've talked to Philip about it in detail okay I don't eat fish that often I like it yeah it's particularly good when you catch it yourself eat it fresh fresh fish really is way better way better way better yeah fish goes bad quick unlike meat yeah like meat you can like let it sit on for a while kind of marinate before you cook you don't marinate fish I think well they do they actually dry age fish okay yeah a lot of places dry age fish drye fish yeah I didn't know that I didn't I wasn't aware of that but that's actually a common practice to dry age fish for certain Sushi dishes like really Gourmet places have you ever been to Sushi by scratch is that in town yeah it's just outside of town he used to run sushi bar and then he sold it's my friend Philip Franklin Lee's a Michelin star Chef he uh used to run sushi bar in town he sold that and then he opened up Sushi by scratch but because of the uh contractual obligations he has to be like outside of the Austin proper so he's about 30 mil away it's [ __ ] fantastic if you like sushi it's like the best sushi you'll ever eat okay I mean it's really insane I I say that with you eat it and you're like Jesus Christ the best sushi of all time Sushi by scratch mhm they have ones in Miami where they have it now Chicago they got a bunch of them he's not allowed to do it in Austin no it's not in Austin proper I think once his contract is up you know he had to non-compete Austin for like three years or something I don't know how long it was but maybe eventually he'll open up one in Austin but it's about 30 minutes outside what what city is it again Cedar past yeah Cedar Creek it's out at Los Pines area yeah it's 30 minutes no big deal Su by scratch got it yeah it's a [ __ ] let me know if you want to go hook it up yeah sure yeah it's awesome it's really worth it like if you like sushi it's a mind blower it's a mindblower and it's on maass so like you sit down they bring you food that's it it looks good it's pretty [ __ ] cool you've been to mahesa in La yes theost B is is great yes that place is outstanding yeah yeah I love good sushi and it's a one of the things is amazing is how many good restaurants there are in Austin I mean for a city that's relatively small I mean the restur for capita is excellent amazing yeah and they're so good there's like so many like artists and restaurants we just found a new one that Brian Simpson told us about it's called bakalar okay it's uh this Mexican restaurant that's in town fantastic really good yeah they just opened up I think they only been open for like six weeks so shout out to them just at there the other night okay it's just there's so many good places here yeah like you can't have a bad restaurant in this town you will go under quickly the competition is strong there so much competition it's like and there's so much variety yeah all kinds lot of good restaurants in the town yeah it's amazing you know I remember uh we were hanging out at your place like way back in the day when I first moved here and you you said something very prophetic when all this was happening like Austin's about to go supernova yeah kind of did yeah it's Boom Town yeah it really is yeah legitimately yep and with uh the gigafactory I mean how many jobs have you brought into Austin from that factory alone well we're about uh 10,000 Direct is um and then I think 50,000 indirect so it's a lot that's pretty [ __ ] awesome yeah I mean there's there's only 2 million people in the great rasten area I know that's crazy um in fact the kind of limiting factor for growth is just finding enough people really yeah this is terrible for sound just have to like the subtitle chewing sounds this is my last piece subtitled drink sound people going to have to deal with it this is my last piece are you taking it away want me to you son of a [ __ ] I should you son of a [ __ ] I I certainly eating myle yeah take it away I'll keep going I'll eat the whole [ __ ] that's the problem being carbs yeah cars are awesome mhm yeah I know it's like uh I feel good though I mean this the dope mean explosion from Cars I'm happy I did it yeah I mean once in a while it's fine once in a while for me it's once in a great while but well there like like Tim Ferris has like that you know you have one whatever one meal a week or something yeah that's good yeah one meal a week I'll go with sweets I'll have a ice cream Sunday or some [ __ ] ice cream sunds are great oh they're [ __ ] amazing fuing amazing yeah I don't most people know what an ice cream sunday tastes like unless they smoke marijuana and then you're like oh this is a different thing uh it's an amazing invention whoever figured out the hot fudge and then the whipped cream on top of it what a combo incredible yeah yeah those too maybe oh yeah maybe great idea I don't know if that's Dairy Queen for sure Dairy Queen well I mean that's what's open right now what's legit it's 11:30 I know think what's that there's like that pizza restaurant that that pizza chain that's they got the best ice cream sunday that I've ever seen it's giant one out here um God I TR remember the name of the it's it's it is a it is a chain but it's not like a big chain people that are upset right now because they're listening like on the treadmill and they're hearing us chewing like these [ __ ] are going to get ice we're seeing pizza and ice cream sunday while people try to lose weight yeah sweating out oh B beos oh yeah they they they if you they've got a gigantic ice cream sunday everything they have is gigantic it's amazing yeah I worked there for a long time it's actually really good it's amazing oh bro they have that rigatoni that rigatoni with the meat sauce and oh my godos is great it's fantastic yeah and if it's very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get yeah this one crazy amount of food yeah it's it's really good yeah um I like a little photographs on the wall there's one of those down the street from our old Studio you knowland Hills remember yeah yeah yeah it's legit yeah yeah um yeah I used used good uh take my kids the one at the Grove in LA what if anything is out near SpaceX like what do you guys have out there in LA or or here out here uh we've got the stalling um terminal Factory so we um for the starlink V4 terminals we build them here we built the what's it called the well the the V version 3 Terminals and the version 3 Min there's like a or there's like we do part of part of the production or actually I should say we've done all of the production of the terminals thus far in La um and um we'll continue to do production in LA but we're also just completed a second Factory um in bastri just about 20 minutes from here and then SpaceX is where you make the launches what what part of Texas is that uh well the Starship stuff is in South Texas uh near the border just uh right on the r Grand and how did you pick that location uh I was just literally looking um at selite images um and and and uh you for for going to orbit you kind of need to you want to launch Eastward so that you can take advantage of Earth rotation to get to orbit so it's a little counterintuitive that um reaching or orbital velocity getting to orbit is about your speed parallel to the Earth's surface it's like how fast are you zooming around Earth uh it's not a like um the gravity at the at the altitude of the space station is almost the same as it is on the ground the reason the space station is actually up there is kind of the wrong terminology it's it's actually moving around the earth at 177,000 M hour so the space station um goes around the earth at roughly every 90 minutes um so so and because Earth is is is turning um and the um the speed at which it is turning um or or the way you experience velocity is is it's moving at like roughly 1,000 mes hour at the Equator so the closer you are to the Equator the more you can take advantage of Earth rotation to reach orbital velocity so you want to and so and and since it's rotating Eastward you want to be on the east coast to get um to make it easier to get to orbital velocity so so you need a section of Coast that's on the East fairly Southward that is not occupied um so like most of really almost really all of Florida except for Cape canaval um is you know wal to wall houses on the beach like there's almost no section of Florida that that every section of Florida has houses except for Cape canaval um which is a government base so one of the few spots that that wasn't occupied was the area just uh adjacent to the border with Mexico um and uh it it just wasn't super well suited to um Holiday Homes um and um there was at one point a development that was going to take place but then a hurricane came and destroyed the the entire place and and in fact rearranged the land so some of the plots were underwater so it's it's kind of a it's a it's a tough spot to um build a home and that's why it was unoccupied so we needed a piece of and it need to be US Territory because go outside the US um there are export restrictions because rocket technology is an advanced weapons technology so we can't just like you know arbitrarily go to another country um so it needed to be us land East Coast um and and fairly Southward that's fascinating that rock one of the few spots that exist like that that Rockets fall into the category of weapons technology yeah intercontinental ballistic missiles h i mean it makes sense yeah we could drop a rocket anywhere nobody can stop us wow that is crazy about the space station too yeah that's going 177,000 miles an hour yes I mean You' seen the videos of the rocket Landing right yes it's amazing very precise it's pretty [ __ ] amazing we can make land basically anywhere no or nut land yeah just I mean doesn't have to turn on this rusters to slow down what is it like to try to juggle these different things in your mind on a daily basis like what is it like to try to juggle X Tesla SpaceX all these different things at the same time it's a lot for a human brain to handle yeah I would imagine yeah my it strains my meat computer I mean do you need something like that though does your meat computer need more problem solving than the average one I mean is this something like if you only had one thing to work on do you think you would get bored or you would get distracted or you would not be satisfied like do you need these things to be so complex and have so many of them simultaneously juggling cuz you didn't pick three easy ones you picked three of the [ __ ] hardest things you could ever get into you already detailed how difficult manufacturing is Rockets duh it's it's one of the craziest things like not only that rocket science completely Innovative rockets that land like they that never happened before so you're doing that right and then you said you know what we got to save Humanity let me go spend 44 billion on Twitter man that was expensive what's it worth what's do you think it was actually worth everything yeah not for the market right I mean like for for humans yes I agree with you I mean I I really genuinely do think this and I've said this many times publically I think you did Humanity an immense service and that if that didn't happen The Narrative of this country would have gone further and further down that road to the point where people would have been scared to speak their mind and they would have scary and it changes the way people communicate at their jobs which changes the way it it just changes the way people when they they leave universities and they go to get jobs the the way they're allowed to communicate and people don't like to be on the outside they don't like to be ostracized they don't like to be kicked out of communities so people would adhere yeah they would change absolutely um people I guess are afraid of like being yeah ostra ostracized is is like fear of of being ostracized I think is the probably the big biggest issue um and then just being totally shut down yeah you know um where you have no Outlet um and you can just basically disappear except for inpost and meetings um so um yeah it was important to uh like steer H have at least one social media outlet that um wasn't canceling people what I really enjoy is uh reading the tweets I guess you still have to call them tweets read posts or whatever I I don't have a good word for it but yeah you can't say the ex's but reading the All My Exes Live in Texas reading the words or should say I enjoy reading the words of people who proclaimed that they were leaving and going over to threads yeah yeah that's what an interesting thing about momentum very difficult to start a whole new social media platform even one that initially got like what what did threads get like some crazy number of initial people signing up for it but it just dropped off within like a couple of weeks now it's a [ __ ] Ghost Town yeah it's like wild eily Qui it's wild I mean zck himself doesn't post so that's what's crazy got you got to use your own product it's interesting though cuz they're sneaking them in now in Instagram they sneak sneak a little thread in there because every now and then I'll see something think oh that's interesting and I click on it oh you [ __ ] and it opens up threads for me like you got me cuz they're you know they're integrated but I don't use Instagram it's fascinating that I'm sure you don't why would you if I bought X or Twitter whatever I wouldn't use anything else either yeah but I didn't use Instagram for for a while um I mean I I mean there was a time where I was posting on Instagram but um I found myself doing selfies and I'm like what the hell is wrong with me why am I posing with selfies to get likes this is crazy bizarre um and I'm like so then I was like you know if if if you if you post with selfies on on on Twitter that people would jump all over you you know yeah they're like that's that's true they were like what's wrong with you that's so true yeah people are like way more lenient on Instagram for some strange reason yeah it's it's like pretty pictures basically yeah so pretty pictures and a lot of [ __ ] a lot of it's there's a lot of weirdness that comes with Instagram like filters like uh I've caught grown men using filters on their pictures it's very strange you know I I I am concerned that like like say Instagram actually leads to uh more unhappiness not not less um in the sense that like it just looks like everyone's like like having a great time and is way better looking than they really are yeah and so you're like man everyone's like good-looking and having a great time and and um then you sort of compare yourself to that and like it's like damn I'm not as good-looking and I'm not I I seem to be sad a lot and you're like man uh you know I think I think it could make you kind of depressed right yeah well and also you're a grown man and you experience this you're also very intelligent you experience this imagine being a young kid Jonathan ha documented that in the codling of the American mind there's a direct correlation between the invention of social media and its ubiquitous use and self harm amongst kids particularly girls it's really bad for girls and they like around 2007 is there's this big uptick on suicide self harm depression yeah um you people can't just like make themselves be better looking with with the there like a limit so right yeah and then surgery yeah it was a big up ticking people getting their jaws reshaped and [ __ ] I mean yeah that's bad so I don't know I think um you know I think I I think like they have to say like is is Instagram a net happiness generator or or not I'm I'm not sure it is speaking of distorted images have you seen the court artists drawing of Sam bankman freed I mean it's I almost like they lost money or something what the [ __ ] happened it looks like it melted have you seen it I just saw he looks like a supermodel oh what s SPF does yes the guy who drew him whoever one of them I saw maybe there's more than one artist maybe there's more than one artist cuz some of those ones I saw were unflattering he looked like an anime superhero you're joking no no like perfect chisel jawline ridiculous he looked like he lost 30 lbs start working out look at this look at that are you kidding what the [ __ ] man look at that guy on the left that guy looks like Superman doesn't he look how hot that guy is I almost feel like it's not or something it might be I feel like someone's [ __ ] with us there's a few other pictures when I Googled like you know there's some rough pictures though it seems like someone's [ __ ] with us cuz that guy's handsome as [ __ ] cuz there's this one that's not the same no that one's terrible that's not real that's Satan's drawing but that one right there if that is real it's like come on that's that's not real this this [ __ ] that's [ __ ] because look at the what they did with the girl oh wow look at that picture there even that picture is car looks like she's melting yeah I don't know I don't I have to I mean but she's probably massively depressed I mean I bet like that's also like an artist interpretation of the energy she's giving off in court I mean she has to rat on her boyfriend and she's already pleaded guilty and you know for a lesser sentence she's going to rat him out well I mean I don't know who spf's PR team is but they uh they're doing an incredible job for real well I mean I mean the dude ripped tons of people off and stole their money and yet he he's getting basically you know backrub from the Press well don't you think that's because the amount of money that he donated yeah I don't know I don't know what the deal is it might have something to do with that I'm not that cynical I I generally don't think people are influenced by money well I don't know what he's doing but something's going on um the number of articles that I've seen where it's like you know where it's basically you know u a misunderstood yeah uh philanthropist uh it's ridiculous well your [ __ ] meter went off when he was offering money to buy in with you with Twitter correct well a large amount yeah um and I mean a lot of people you know um fell for is [ __ ] um but I mean I first of all I hadn't really heard of the guy I'm like who who is this guy and um what did he do and he's in the Bahamas H that's that's pretty sus to begin with he's very sus um like who's who's like if you're on a tropical island like your Finance organizations in Tropical Islands are generally have bad track record um and he's involved in crypto and crypto is there's a lot of the scam probability in crypto is high it's high so yeah I'm not saying it's all scams but no that I would leave that distinction for um for what are those [ __ ] nfts I think that's that's like 80% scam except for people people's legit I me gives you like digital art yeah people stuff is great um but I mean nfts the funny thing is that the nft is not even on the blockchain it's just a URL to the to the the jpeg so it's not even like it's like you should at least encode the jpeg in the blockchain cuz like if the URL if the company housing the image goes out of business you don't have the image anymore I never understood it I tried so hard I tried so hard I know I have a friend who made Millions selling an an artist I'm like okay save that money because eventually people are going to figure this out like I mean this with with art there is a fair bit of money laundering and tax voidance that that is uh so some of these things that seem inexplicable like H Biden you talk about H bence paintings I did he actually sell paintings for large sums of money immense sums of money okay it's hundreds of thousands ofll probably that that that that's that seems unlikely to be a legit transaction unlikely right unlikely yeah very the work's not bad though I got to say like for that kind of [ __ ] art it's not that bad yeah um I mean the thing is that it's it's hard to Price art right yeah because in the eye of the beholder so how can you say whether something like this is his stuff how muches that go for 225k a steel it's not bad it's not that bad that's not that bad like I mean I would buy that I wouldn't buy it for 225 but I buy it for five yeah it's not bad like look a lot of crackheads are good artists like you know you get crazy on drugs and splatter some [ __ ] around and you got a unique Vision that's not bad bad it's not bad that's not that is not bad at all how much did that one go for I so he's a he's probably a legit Meanwhile we're going to find out he had a ghost artist I mean I suspect he I mean artist think uh he he's he's not untalented um right so I mean I actually don't have any issues his lifestyle or anything there's his stuff that stuff's not bad like whatever that dog wolf thing is on the wall that's pretty dope yeah I like that what does it say underneath it can you read it I can't read it either way not bad it's not bad it's not bad have you ever heard the theory that the entire modern art movement like Jackson Pollock and the like was a a CIA scop um I mean I have heard that but I I have not heard any evidence for it I read the article a couple years ago okay at least uh modern arts a sop yeah every day I wake up was that long s but it was fascinating yeah every day yeah there's always something cat with a tin foil hat yeah when was this beginning of 2020 really a CIA SC but I mean if you can get someone to spend that kind of money on that kind of [ __ ] like the Jackson pul stuff so here it is p PR um preeminent culture War Cold War what is it okay uh the relationship between Modern Art and American diplomacy began during World War II museum Moma battle for hearts and Minds it's an interesting article so I I read the article a couple years ago I can't remember what their argument was but it's one of those things starts there like they spent money to buy paintings directly from artists the 40s theit okay even though Modern Art and American diplomacy were uh of a piece Soviet propaganda asserted that the United States was a was culturally a culturally Barren capitalist Wasteland to make the case for American cultural dynamism dynamism the state department in 1946 spent $49,000 to purchase 79 paintings directly from American modern artists and mounted them in a traveling e exhibition called advancing American art that e exhibition which made made stops in Europe and Latin America included work from artists like George O'Keefe and Jake George O'Keefe is the lady who makes vaginas right isn't that her work I don't know I think I think some of what she does yeah I think she makes like vagina like flowers and stuff I mean I think some of was pretty good but um well the Jackson po one was like how did come on Happ that that one is just wild cuz I I really think I could do that some [ __ ] have like Jackson P the CIA teamed up to win the Cold War yeah okay this I think that's the article I read because that's 2017 I don't remember but well I I I think you know OD is is very much in the eye of the beholder it's like what what does it make you how does it make you think and feel and if it makes you think and feel in a way that you like it then it's good yes absolutely yeah but it's also um a way to launder money yes um a number of these like very high price art things are um tax evasion and money laundering have you ever uh seen the documentary on the Lost Leonardo um no that's crazy that's crazy MBS purchased this okay and he purchased it for some insane amount of money it turns out it probably isn't Leonardo da Vinci not only that but the vast majority of the painting was made by a modern age woman who recreated everything okay like so she in restoring air quotes restoring she she essentially repainted the image in the style of Da Vinci okay and it's it's very sketchy because if you look at the original painting it was all [ __ ] up and missing paint and there was many layers someone had painted over it it's it's really an incredible documentary because it just shows how much [ __ ] is involved in these high dollar transactions and I think it went I think it was the most expensive painting that was ever sold I think it went for something in the neighborhood of $400 million $450 million yeah the lost lonardo a new film solved the mystery of the world's most expensive painting is the $450 million Salvatore Mundy a fake this film featuring tear tearful Copans sneering experts dodgy dealers and a secretive super yacht May finally settle the great Da Vinci controversy apparent apparently there's mult multiple layers and different styles of painting involved in it and when they do some sort of a comprehensive examination whether it's like you know I don't know what kind of imagery they're using but they're doing something when they can say like this has been painted many times and [ __ ] with it might it might have originally been one of Leonardo's students might not have been Leonardo like there's not okay a real to that that time yeah okay but whether it was it sou bees that sold it I think so yeah so so they were kind of aware that there was some Shenanigans with this piece but they also were aware that this was this was going to Ching this was three lemons this was uh they were going to hit the jackpot with this bad boy yeah and so they went through with it and yeah Chris Chris that's it the other one Christie's uh was aware of it's a fascinating document I don't know what's right I don't know what's wrong it might be real but at the very least it's been retouched mostly by this woman isn't it like 90% of the painting it's some there's some very high percentage of the painting that was actually made by this woman and they they show her she worked on it forever for years and years worked like painstakingly to retouch this piece of art which is very odd yeah that they do that cuz like wouldn't you just want it all [ __ ] up and old sure I mean that's the real piece of art yeah the real piece of art is not like some woman in 2001 yeah painting over it that's just crazy yeah um I mean I I you know I I enjoy art for the Aesthetics but but not for the name name value yeah I feel the same way yeah I enjoy art just because I just what it makes you how it makes you feel you know it's it's you know it's a cool thing I mean I mean obviously my studio is filled with it like you go outside I love art it's everywhere out there I'm just I love it have you SE oh the the woman have you seen the one the piece that she made of you this uh Melania Blackman have you seen that drawing that she did is that the weird one she it's everything it's it's she it's enormous okay she draws it and you're essentially made up of all these different characters and different things so here you can find her work of his she did one of me and she did one of Anthony Baine that I bought that's out there as well she's super talented this woman so this is her she's really hot too okay so you can find her standing next to it there it is Instagram or something Instagram Bandit oh that was right there was something that happened where Instagram did something what happened so Instagram is not only Banned Me from promoting this artwork but also shadowbanned me alt together after I posted my latest piece this is after probably you said that you wanted to fight Zucker well actually I was just Zuck fight Zuck fight is funny um because uh you know he was posting all these fight videos and then someone on Twitter at the time said um hey you should fight Zuck and I said well I'm willing to fight if he if he is um and um and then Zuck posted uh I think on Instagram or something uh name the place or something something like that effect and I was like okay how about the Vegas octagon um and then um and then uh Italy actually was willing to let us use the Coliseum so I was like well let's can't turn that down you know um and then um but then and then I was like well if it's going to be in the Coliseum you know we like I like UFC and everything but we don't have like tons of ads and and UFC branding on the Coliseum because it's a historical you know play it's a history you know it's a place of great history you don't want to just uh you know have it be like NASCAR so so then um and then Zuck Zuck pulled out you know use the pulled out method um so he pulled out he pulled out of it yeah yeah oh what was the narrative what did you hear jimie I don't remember well I'm will so he was like oh no it's got to be UFC Rules I'm like well okay we got have us rules in the Coliseum it's fine but we just don't want to have we got to respect the historical Integrity of the place you just the Coliseum just seems like the coolest place to do it that's why I mean like Gladiator you know come on and if they said it's okay yeah so he just wants it to be in the actual UFC like in Vegas so so then he said oh well you know uh like he accused me of not like not being being serious and I said look listen at the end of the day if I'll fight you any place anywhere under any rules oh Z that's what I said so so I'm you know name the he said name of the place I'm like I'm if I'm happy to fight him in a house on a mouse with a louse we like Go full Dr Seuss here now how much time I'm way bigger than him this is unfair I don't think he should fight me um because because you're so much bigger than him yeah I'm like 50% him yeah I'll just use a war I've got my panded War Rus move I just lie on him War move well you know like War Rus doesn't need martial arts training right cuz it's really big you don't want to go wrestling a warus right cuz he's going to roll on you have you ever been ever rolled with someone who's much smaller than you that does Jiu-Jitsu yes Lex yeah yeah yeah no I I did 10 years of marads um how much have you trained personally I for a decade of it well you did a lot of karate right uh I did Judo Judo Kai kin Kai karate yeah um I did some Jiu-Jitsu Taekwondo um street fighting which I was involuntary um I I I'm you know I think I'd be decent I I did martial competitions when I was a teenager really interesting so look at you George St Pierre Elon John Doner the Great Master and Lex fredman but like like Lex is a I think he's got like 20% heavier than Zuck so and I'm way bigger than Lex yeah that's why they have weight categories oh yeah yeah yeah um did you get a chance to talk to donaher at all the guy on the left that guy's F do you know his history no he's from New Zealand or something he was a professor of philosophy at Columbia okay and fell in love with jiu-jitsu okay I mean fell in love with it to the point where he was sleeping on the mats and teaching all day long he's an obsessive he is a real Kaizen disciple and oh man he is one of the most unique characters I've ever met in my life one of the most brilliant men I've ever met and he's completely dedicated to Jiu-Jitsu and he has raised through this particularly this one disciple Gordon Ryan who also lives here in Austin he's the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time there's no question and he's only 28 okay he might even be 27 or maybe he's 28 now but I mean he is universally regarded as the greatest of all time and he is John's greatest student okay and the two of them together because Gordon has insane work ethic they work 365 days a year they do not take any days off they train every day that's Gordon to the right of John with the the crazy beard he doesn't really have that hair he bleaches it but the two of them together are literally an Unstoppable combination I like Al look ripped he's pretty ripped yeah he's a combination of gigantic brilliant and insanely dedicated with the most incredible instructor that's ever existed I mean John Doner is universally regarded as the greatest jiu-jitsu instructor alive and his student is universally regarded as the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor alive yeah and it is because John is like a complete AB like a guy out of a superhero book like you wouldn't you you're not going to find another one of those a guy with a genius level IQ who's one of I mean you talk to him he's fascinating and he is obsessed with Combat Sports Warfare like th like strategy yeah brilliant guy yeah brilliant guy see I was impressed when I met him um I mean the things that like uh if I was fighting someone who I was not where I was not much bigger than them then I would be more concerned um how much time would you need to prepare I don't need any time no time at all no how's your cardio it's not it's not it that will not be a factor really yeah very I I mean what's the likelihood of this actually happening I like I'm willing to do it anytime anywhere any place any rules well I think this stating it this way might accelerate this process especially on this platform I mean I I challenge him to a duel under any circumstances a sword fight sure Jesus that's not NE pist at dawn that's not necessary I think physical hand Nerf guns at noon yeah Nerf guns at noon well you could you could slash it out in the metaverse but uh yeah in the real world I listen I it there's there's just a reason they have weight categories you know um so uh you know there's a a friend of mine who is pretty good at fighting um but she weighs she weighs about half of what I do and um and I said let me let me show you why there's weight categories on been fighting and I'm I'm going to do a move called the war and and you have to just I'm just going to lie on you I'm not going to put you in a lock or anything I'm just going to lie on you but I'm going to you know position myself such that it's hard to get off out from under me and I just going to lie Crossways on you and and you you try to get get away and you won't be able to get away you couldn't just you know like like if a horse falls on you right you can get trapped under a horse but you're not a horse what do you weigh about 2:30 yeah 2 240 yeah yeah so no no I'm not a horse but I'm saying in the limit if something's heavy enough like you know if a horse falls in you and dies you can get trapped under a horse and not be able to get yourself out right but if someone's good enough I mean I'm sure you've seen like absolute weight classes in Jiu-Jitsu where you'll get 145lb competitor who strangles a 220 lb competitor and they're both well trained because if someone is that good that's unlikely it's not unlikely it happens quite often when you get Elite competitors when you get Elite competitors like Elite black belts at the 145 155lb weight limit you'd be shocked there's a ton of videos of these guys who will strangle much larger black belts I'm not saying it's impossible it's just highly unlikely um and if if if this were not the case there would not be strict weight categories in marshs that is true that is true but the reason why they allow absolutes in Jiu-Jitsu is uh because the it is the thrill of watching these smaller people go against much larger people and sometimes they win no I I just just like um armies you know the people take note when a small army defeats a big army because it is so unusual yes not because it's normal right um you know if there's like it's like it was two against 10,000 and boy would beat those two guys up more likely what happens like if if if you're severely outnumbered uh you will lose uh almost certainly so look at the size difference between these two guys play it out well it's the end of the video this is uh Mikey musami who is another fascinating individual this guy is another Super Genius who trains every day 12 hours a day and uh he is competing against a black belt in the heavyweight division Mikey musi might weigh 145 pounds and he beats this guy guy doesn't look to be in super great shape well he's enormous yeah I mean he's enormous and he's a black belt so he's skilled I forget how Mikey wins this he catches I couldn't tell what exactly happened get it a little bit further here I think what happened here it seemed like he got penalties or something oh they pushed him out of bounds I don't know what that won on the I think they're out of bounds there yeah that's all that it was that's just out of bounds so scoot ahead see what happens what he catches him with what happened I'm not saying it's impossible it's just very unlikely by points yeah I so won by point I think you're making the point for me here yeah well in that case that guy's strangled a lot of much larger people than him um but again he's extraordinary he's a world champion he's a world champion for one which is this huge uh organization Singapore they do these events where they have all kinds of different martial arts they have MMA tie boxing yeah yeah um so you would do it under any rules sure all right let's go I like it I like the fact that you're interested in doing this it's fun um it makes it fun yeah I mean I I I could you know this this could be an exercise in hubris find out we could find out i' like the fact that zuck's interested in it too I like the fact that he uh he trained so much yeah I mean there's there aren't very many ways to actually if if you stick with the rules that you just to um like for example if you want to put somebody in an on loock you have to be able to extend their arm mhm and if you if you if somebody is strong enough that they that you cannot extend their arm then you're limited to chokes chokes and and you can you can do uh an arm lock across the groin with with both arms and legs like uh hoist Gracie did upside down and I think it was like the third UFC fight or something like that yeah he was pretty severely damaged that was in femo yeah that nor guy yeah and he did upside down um arm lock across the groin because he could not do an arm loock um you know a sort of sidebar armlock so um but after that people were like wise to that move so they're like we're not going to be allow themselves to get a armlock across the grin without you know that that was like a you know overconfidence I think um well it was exhaustion I mean they fought like tooth and nail for something like seven or eight minutes and you know hoist survived and then eventually wore the guy well when you're a big steroid Ed up guy like that too the oxygen depletion like the amount of oxygen your muscles require you gas out pretty quickly when you're that big unless you're insanely conditioned yeah but like there there's no way for him to do um you know arm lock like an a single a single arm arm lock uh he couldn't do it because single arm arm lock like if if you try to do a lock on the side so like a side control so from some like legs across your face is that what you mean no if if if you try to do do do an arm bar on the side you know one one arm across the the knee you know across the thigh like you have to be able to extend the arm your your your uh essentially your um you know triceps have to be able to exceed the strength of their bicep is where it comes down to but if you cannot exceed the strength of that bicep then you will not be able to do an an arm extension I'm not sure what I'm are you talking about like a Cura like a straight arm bar yeah oh so you're talking about like with just the arms where you just have one arm like like you if it's if it's one arm versus one arm but that's never the case it's almost always the whole body's engaged that that's I think that's it's well in Judo that's a very common hold very common line a one arm arm bar yeah one arm yeah um you know you have your one arm around the the neck mhm and and you take their arm and you extend it across oh I see what you're saying okay so like from a scarf hold so a scarf hold you would take the arm and put it over and You' push push it down with one arm yeah that's unusual though yeah that's an unusual arm bar but if one person is much stronger than another then they that one that that is that's the move yeah but it's a very fast move because you can take someone right from a throat drop them on the floor right into an arm bar yeah okay that's a very specific arm bar 10 seconds right that's a rare arm bar you never see that in MMA what you do see though is the two legs isolate the arm and then the person grabs a hold of it with a thumb up and uses all their body weight yeah yeah that's what that's what Gracie did yeah that's what most people do when they apply an arm bar yeah whether it's from the back like you know a lot of people have done that or whether it's from side control which is a little more easy because you have control of the body yeah I mean it's also just that that um you know UFC is not just Jiu-Jitsu you can punch people right that makes big difference big difference big difference huge yeah MMA uh has changed the ideas of Jiu-Jitsu because there's a lot of techniques that people do where it works well in competition when someone's like grabbing your leg when you can't just rain down punches on their face yeah there's a lot of unreal somebody's pounding in the face is pretty hard to to be chill you know especially if they're W if if if somebody's got gorilla fists in your face yes um it's not going to be a good day yeah Carlson Gracie famously had a phrase that if you take a black belt you punch him in the face he becomes a brown belt punch punch punch him again he be comes a purple belt and so on and so forth if if if I mean most people have not been punched in the face I've been punched in the face um so you know it it comes as a surprise yeah yeah it probably does come as a surprise there also like even even the UFC has a lot of limitations like you can't do 12:00 elbows you know so that's that's changing they're getting rid to do 12:00 elos finally finally I've been singing that from the top of the roof forever okay it's so nuts it's so stupid you know where it came from no it came from uh Big John McCarthy who was the original UFC referee okay and uh Pioneer of the sport he was bringing this to athletic commissions and they were allowing certain techniques but one of them they wouldn't allow was the 12 to six L because they saw those late night karate demonstrations where someone like smash bricks like that they thought someone would die if they hit him with this definitely going to sting yeah but it's not even harder than this one this one's harder because this one you can throw your body weight into it and it's a more natural movement this is an unusual movement I mean I'm sure you could train it and get it probably as hard but I think for most people for me I can tell you for sure this elbow has more power well I think any elbow in the face is going to be a big wake up Co if you've never had an ala in it [ __ ] sucks yes it [ __ ] sucks did you watch the Tyson Fury Francis andano boxing match is that the one we bet the ear off no this is the that's That's Mike Tyson of Ander Holyfield that's from the 90s yeah no this fight that took place this last weekend Francis and who was the UFC heavyweight champion he vacated the belt so he could take this fight with Tyson Fury this was his dream fight Tyson Fury who's the lineal heavyweight champion Francis inano had never had a boxing match ever in his life had zero boxing matches but he was the UFC heavyweight champion okay knocked down Tyson Fury in the third round beat him up in the eighth round most people including me thought he should have won the decision including most boxers most boxing pundits and he lost by one point on one judge's scorecard he won on one judge's scorecard another judge who should go to jail had it 9693 for Tyson Fury which is [ __ ] outrageous but Francis inana who is a a literal freak of nature I mean this guy grew up in Cameroon and was working in the sand mines when he was a child like a [ __ ] Conan movie like full on Warrior con like pushing the thing around in C he's developing his body digging in the sand all day he's supremely physically Advanced he's not just fit he's the hardest puncher ever measured in all of MMA there's a machine that we actually have outside at the gym and if you hit this thing Francis has hit it harder than any person who's ever lived yeah well look at him look can I hit it yeah we can set it up I had the record for the kick for a while okay yeah somebody a couple people beat it now but Francis punched like it's an insane it's like getting hit by a [ __ ] car sure and when he dropped Tyson Fury in the third round you see Tyson's on his back going what the [ __ ] and then he realizes like cuz he I think he yeah a sledgehammer he thought he was going to run him over because he's the boxing heavyweight champion he's like there's no way this guy could box with me he even said at the beginning of the fight it's time to go to school okay and then Francis said at the end of the fight you are a shitty professor you should watch it it's a good free show it's on ESPN plus you can still I'm pretty sure you can still get it yeah um anyway I just uh it's uh yeah I'm just excited that you're interested in doing it still sure all right didn't you [ __ ] your back up doing like sumo wrestling yeah what what what happened there uh still hurts a little bit actually I've had like four operations really from that well I had like I I mean I had like some childhood injuries uh like I said I was in some pretty severe fights as a kid like really like I was almost killed at one point so really what happen I was just in school in South Africa it's a very violent place um so um there's been many involuntary fights it's just the way it was um but anyway so I had like and I had some rugby injuries as well um I saw South South Africa won the World Cup which is cool and in rugby um so uh so so I think that that was like not a good starting position uh but then um the world champion Su wrestlers world champion s wrestler they did kind of like a demo bout for my birthday um and since it was my birthday they I guess they just they call up the birthday boy and say like hey do you want to Su my wrestle this is where like it's a similar weight differential he was 50% heavier than me so um like I don't know 360 370 lbs um and um it's I KN I knew You' take it easy on me in the first round so the only way I'm going to knock him over is is momentum so I got to basically run at him um so I did uh run at him did a judo throw knocked him over um and smashed the disc in my neck in the process oh yeah it's like it' be like running at that wall you know if you run out of wall it's kind of hurt did you have to get it fused or anything yeah oh man that's so it's like you can knock you can you you can knock over someone you can defeat someone bigger than you if willing to you know smash a disc in your neck yeah well if you know what you're doing and you're willing to smash a disc on your neck those two things so he wasn't expecting me to be a total lunatic on round one um and he defeated me obviously in round two and three because he was like oh eyes knows what to effect but um so I had like 5 minutes of glory and a decade of pain um now that you've got your your neck fuse that that creates problems with the upper and lower discs as well doesn't it over time if there's too much neck rotation it can be it can damage the how long ago was this you had this operation man I had three operations where you got it fused how long ago I had two artificial discs and I'm actually in favor of artificial discs they put the wrong wrong ones wrong disc in but then eventually the third one is like let's just fuse it um they put the wrong one in yeah twice so and how how cuz I have friends that have artificial discs I'm actually in favor of artificial discs you just need to have the right one so in in my case um the this point I know a lot about it the the C5 c c C6 right facet uh is impacting the the you know the facets are like the Outriggers you got the center core of the spine facets the Outriggers and they're shingled so they're they're like you know one on top of the other like this there's a little nerve that goes out in between the C5 C6 and and and if those if those verb come close together they they grind the Nerf um so you get the they just sort of start shearing the nerve um now um so my my my my my my C5 C6 right forcet and it it shows up clear as on like a technum scan so if you could do like a radioactive scan with tech technum uh it's very clear um where the problem is um so what should have been done was uh a simple hinge like a a you know basically to move the uh move the verterra the the the basically the C5 verterra back about maybe an eighth of an inch to sort of unload the facet and then put a simple hinge so just just rotation um but I was given a what is a called a mobc which is a more mobile disc the MC allows it not just rotation but also translation so it can move back and forth so that that then didn't solve the impacting of the C5 C6 because because it could it could slide and when it would slide forward the C5 C6 would bang and crunch the nerve and what does the normal neck do does the normal move forward in that way the the disc is like it's like a Gummy Bear basically normally so it allows rotation and translation so it's like it's like sitting on like a jell pillow that's what like one of those bosu balls that people sit on sometimes they work rber desk it's like a rubber pillow basically yeah um U so the natural disc allows for rotation and translation so um they basically put a disc that had too much mobility in and did not solve the C5 C6 no of impact so then then anyway the third time around I was like listen I just don't want to take a chance here let's just fuse it oh wow and so it just limits your Mobility no I'm fine I'm like I can look right and left it's it's okay yeah it's okay yeah I'm not like you know totally stiff necked no you don't seem like you're stiff necked at all no there was a guy who fought in the UFC named yoel Romero and uh he's a real freak too amazing athlete and he came from the uh Cuban wrestling program he was a one of one of the greatest wrestlers that's like ever competed amateur Wass he had his entire neck fused and when he runs like his neck doesn't move it's kind of freakish okay like you see him running and his neck looks like it's a stick wow and the whole body is like like moving around but the neck is just locked in place it's very bizarre to look at I mean he runs like a man whose entire neck is fused like watch him see if you can show the image of him here watch him run wow see how his neck he's in good shape oh yeah you think I mean you don't get in any better shape than this guy by the way he looks like that now and he's 46 47 years old and still competing at the highest level okay in Bellator I mean he's an unbelievable athlete and one of the most explosive guys that's ever fought in the sport just insanely powerful and fast yeah cool so you compete at the highest level with your neck fused yeah yeah yeah I'm not I'm not too worried about that Alaine Sterling who was the UFC banway champion he um got his Nick neck fused and then or not got a disc replac rather in his neck and then went on to defend his title three times still fighting at the highest level with a fake disc in his neck well I guess it'll be okay then yeah well Medical Science pretty [ __ ] incredible what they can do now you know I mean injuries that would have like you would have been [ __ ] for the rest of your life just a few decades ago yeah now you're good to go yeah so I'm excited we've kind of rekindled this Zuck versus El on fire I mean he's checking out what that's the I don't think he's checking it out yeah there no he's checking out you think so yeah buck buck buck well maybe he's suck oh him into fighting using tuns it might work yeah it I mean somehow or another you got him to agree in the first place I was stunned surely he will respond to a Tor like that yeah surely I mean how can you resist how can he resist resist yeah exactly just go let's go full School schoolyard uh torting what if there was like real um consequences on the line like what if you guys had a real bet okay sure like the moderation team from X takes over moderation of Facebook if if you win no problem it sounds good and if he wins Vice vers it a fight for civilization yeah a literal fight for civilization I mean I'll do it wow heavy true and you wouldn't even train for this no I train a little bit train a little bit Yeah like how many weeks you need I mean I I I don't have to train I could do it like tomorrow I tried going to his house actually did you really yeah cuz he lives in paloalto um and we're doing some um you know Tesla full self-driving testing so I'm like well got to pick a destination you press the button go to navigate to zuck's house yeah basically he's not far he's like a I think he's like three miles away from the Tesla Tesla California headquarters wow um but uh I don't know there's nobody there it's probably in Hawaii he was according to a spokesman he was traveling Oh yeah been wild if he was there yeah you say literally like like anytime I just thought it was funny um to go like you know I'm coming over to your house I'm gonna get you well it's even more funny when it's two of the richest guys in the world yeah yeah um so anyway you didn't uh didn't answer yeah too bad yeah too bad it's uh it's just fun it's fun and I'm I'm glad you're you're just for the fun of it I mean I think it would be well actually like Dana Dana White thinks it would be like the like the you know a really big ticket fight it would be [ __ ] huge yeah I would commentate on that yeah I mean the pro could go to charity and stuff it be yeah it' be crazy people would want to see what the hell is going on oh my God it would be [ __ ] huge yeah yeah it would be really crazy crazy like if if they close the thing yeah and Bruce Buffer is in there it's time the place would go [ __ ] bananas bananas yeah yeah let's do it does it have to be in the Coliseum would you agree no I'll do it anywhere I I literally said anywhere anytime you know where you should do any rules you know you should do it the sphere in Las Vegas the sphere is great the amazing it's amazing it's amazing yeah I was there I've only seen it on the outside but it looks the inside's even better I've seen video I haven't seen it live but I I was there on Saturday night and it was it's awesome like it's really good I think it might be the best show on earth oh yeah yeah I mean if you have visuals that uh accompany the music like if you have like someone like Roger Waters like which his show is like insanely visual something like that and sphere would be the art the art in the show that I saw on Saturday night was incredibly good I I don't know who did all the art but what was the band oh was you oh yeah yeah but but I mean I've been to YouTu concerts and you is great but but but um the sphere is really like if YouTube hadn't been there it still be great yeah you YouTube's it's like a you know like on Sunday there was a movie that was played a movie there whoow um where do you look yeah in all directions oh my God yeah are you I mean it's like actually being like in in virtual reality in fact it was such it was so wild the Saturday night one especially uh that you you you step outside after the show and like you're like why is reality so boring oh so this is a postcard from Earth Daren aros's thing oh wow and you're watching this I saw that on Sunday and it covers the whole ceiling oh my God it's really great you saw it there yeah oh my God that's a that's incredible yeah it's really good that' be the greatest movie ever I think like Saturday night the saturday night show and obviously YouTube adds to it but like I said the the sphere is really special in and of itself um I think it's probably the best show I've ever seen wow yeah I could imagine I mean it's just what an amazing venue and what an incredible idea to have the entire ceiling all screen I got to hand it to Dolan that was pretty amazing absolutely amazing I'm I'm so glad that he did that and then also the outside oh that's incredible they really play with perspective God that's it's it's round but it doesn't look round right so it'll it'll be like it'll simulate like a like a square like all sorts of shapes wow and then also the outside of it like they had the outside of it it looked like Earth it's just amazing it's really cool yeah super cool so I like these epic things that's the venue you know it's really cool that's the venue that's where it needs to go down in the sphere sure yeah that's even better than Coliseum okay yeah especially if the United States Falls that would be our Coliseum this would be our Rome Vegas will be our Rome I mean the spirit remind spot of being like a modern day Coliseum yeah yeah like a modern day version like what they do yeah with art technology currently yeah and then Vegas is like kind of rasque in the sense that when we think about like the the Hedonism of Rome its final days that's Vegas yeah yeah totally yeah perfect yeah let's go let's go are you not entertained you will [ __ ] be entertained you'll be [ __ ] you'll be [ __ ] entertained entertained no doubt um let's do it there's one point in time you were trying to get people to do a pause on AI I mean I I signed on to a letter that someone else wrote um I didn't think that people would actually pae but you thought it was probably a good idea if they did I mean I think so yeah I mean making some sort of digital super intelligence seems like it could be dangerous it certainly has a potential and certainly has the potential well when you were talking about the the what this mind virus how it was able to propagate through the the social media and being in control of social media platforms think about what that means if that same mind virus gets in control of a super intelligence and that is possible no that's what that's actually what I think the biggest danger is for AI is that if AI is implicitly programmed I don't think they can do it explicitly but implicitly programmed with values that lead to that that that have led to the destruction of downtown San Francisco and a bunch of these AI companies are in the San in either in San Francisco or in the San Francisco Bay Area then uh you could implicitly program an AI to believe that Extinction of humanity is the what it should try to do I if you take that guy who was on the front page of New York Times and you take his philosophy which is prevalent in San Francisco um the AI could could conclude like he did that there are eight where he literally says there are 8 billion people in the world it would be better if there are none and engineer that outcome yeah well especially if it doesn't need us anymore if it becomes sensient and then has the ability to make its own decisions and make a better version of itself it would find us to be nothing but a problem like we have nothing to offer anymore R yeah it is a risk so um you know and like if you query chat gbt I mean it's pretty woke you know yeah so um you people did like experiments like write a poem praising Donald Trump and they it won't but but you ask write a poem praising Joe Biden and it will yeah so I'm like you know that's a little sketchy yeah yeah well it's unfortunately it's programmed and yes it's programmed to be that way is it possible to overcome those problems is it possible that we could realize the dangers that are involved in creating this but somehow another engineer it in a way that would be ultimately beneficial to people or is that just a whim as a hope and a prayer utopian version of what could happen versus the most likely outcome if you say like what is the most likely outcome of AI I think the most likely outcome to to be specific about it is is a good outcome most likely a good outcome but it's not for sure so I think we have to be careful how we program the AI um and make sure that it is not accidentally anti-human so um yeah you know the accidentally extinctionist AI you wouldn't want that or even pruning well that that's that is kind of how it works is that these um what they call large language models but you know it's really just a big pile of numbers um and how you tune those numbers matters uh it's like it's like pruning a tree you know you could have a Mighty Oak you could be a little Bonsai or Mighty Oak so depending on how you PR it right that's what I'm saying like if it decided to prune if it decided the the the real issue perhaps yeah we we we cause problems uh or maybe it would prune places in the world that are you know o overwhelmingly polluting like third world countries maybe it would decide that they're not very necessary particularly if we use computers or AI or some sort of Robotics to do human labor and then you have these areas where human beings are doing this labor and they're polluting and you know there's all sorts of issues that come about because of that you say well we just eliminate those people we eliminate that issue and then we have 30% less garbage in the ocean and then it makes this call yeah yeah there something we should be concerned about and and I I I I actually to go oh [ __ ] I I sorry I need to go should we wrap it up yeah cuz I I have to go to the airport um I have to fly I'm flying to London yeah you explaining that yeah just um for AI safety AI safety conference in London so yeah I'm leaving in about an hour and a half what do you hope to get out of this uh conference like well I don't know um I mean I'm I'm just generally concerned about AI safety but I it's like what should we do about it [Music] um I don't know um have some some some kind of regulatory oversight of some kind it's like you can't just go build a nuclear bomb in your backyard you know that that's against the law and you'll get thrown in prison if you do that how much of a concern I think maybe more dangerous than a nuclear bomb really yes how much of a concern is it if another country develops it before us um I don't I don't know if if that the we just be concerned about AI being um anti-human that's the sort of the thing um that matters so potentially um I'm saying it's it's it's like a genie letting a genie out of a bottle you know it's sort of like a magic Genie that can make wishes come true except um usually when they tell those stories that doesn't end well for the person who let the Gen out of the bottom right do you think we're creating a life form um yeah I mean it's something that is indistinguishable from in from intelligence an intelligent life form certainly I I keep coming up against this idea I keep banging it in my head that we're some sort of an electronic caterpillar that's creating a cocoon and we don't even realize what we're doing and we're about to give birth to some technological butterfly yeah yeah well I think that's we're on the cusp of an artificial intelligence Revolution and um you know for the longest time or for a very long time uh We've the smartest creatures on Earth that's been our defining characteristic I mean I mean speaking of martial arts I mean I I don't think anyone should challenge a silver back gorilla to a fight you know um even if you're very good at wash lots that thing's going to kill you um you know it literally walks on its fists if those fists meet your face it's game over um so but so we're not we're not stronger than a gorilla we're not um we're not faster than other animals we're smarter um now what happens when there's something way smarter than us where does it go it's a good question yeah well listen go talk to those people go school them and I I hope something good comes out of it and um thank you for your time appreciate you coming in here it's been fun good to see you always good to see you thank you thanks for everything man thanks for buying Twitter too you're welcome really it means hopefully it a for good you know that is aspirationally a Force for good I think it at the very least it stopped a lot of bad yeah good all right bye everybody all right [Music]",

    "transcript": "- The following is a\nconversation with Elon Musk, his fourth time on this,\nthe Lex Fridman Podcast. (Elon whistling) I thought you were gonna finish it. (Elon whistling) It's one of the greatest\nthemes in all film history. (whistling continues) - Yeah, that's great. - So I was just thinking\nabout the Roman Empire. As one does.\n(Elon laughing) - There's that whole meme where old guys are thinking about the Roman\nEmpire at least once a day. - And half the population's confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously thinking about the wars going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of\nRoman society and culture. And it, I think, has been\na big part of most empires and dynasties throughout\nhuman history, so. - Yeah, they usually came\nas a result of conquest. I mean, there's some,\nlike the Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot\nof sort of clever marriages. - But fundamentally there's\nan engine of conquest. They celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders\nwere excellent generals. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- That kind of thing. So a big picture question, Grok approved, I asked if this is a good question to ask. - [Elon] Get tested Grok approved. - Yeah. At least on fun mode. (Elon laughing) To what degree do you think\nwar is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured? I ask this as you have\nsomehow controversially been a proponent of peace. - I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real\nenemy to be countered. That's the real hard part. Not, you know, fighting other humans. But all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is a, you look at the, people\nthink of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing. But in fact it is not. There's some quite funny\nWerner Herzog thing where he is like in the jungle, like saying that it's\nlike basically just murder and death in every direction. I mean, the plants, animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other, every single day, every minute. So it's not like, you know,\nwe're unusual in that respect. - Well, there's a relevant question here. Whether with greater intelligence\ncomes greater control over these base instincts for violence. - Yes. We have much more\nvulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence\nthan say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks and say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society\nis filled with violence. And it's quite, quite horrific, frankly, that that's our limbic system in action. Like, you don't wanna be on\nthe wrong side of a chimpanzee, they'll eat your face off\nand tear and nuts off. - Yeah, basically, there's\nno limits or ethics or there almost had just war. There's no just war in\nchimpanzee societies, is war and dominance\nby any means necessary. - Yeah, chimpanzee society is a pro, like a permanent version of human society. They're not like peace\nloving basically at all. There's extreme violence. And then once in a while, somebody who's watched\ntoo many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, and then that eats their\nface or rip their nuts off or chew their fingers off\nand that kind of thing. It's happened several times. - Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction. - It's happened to\npeople. It's unfortunate. Like that's, I guess a one way to ensure that the other chimp\ndoesn't like, you know, contribute to the gene pool. - Well, from a martial arts perspective is the fascinating strategy. - (laughing) The nut riper. (laughing) - I wonder which of the\nmartial arts teaches that one. - I think it's safe to say\nif somebody's got your nuts in their hands and as the\noption ripping them off, you'll be amenable to whatever they want. - Yeah.\n(Elon laughing) - So like I said, somehow controversially, you've been an proponent\nof peace on Twitter, on X. - Yeah. - So let me ask you about\nthe wars going on today and to see what the\npath to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in\nthat part of the world? - Well, I think that part of\nthe world is definitely like, if you look up the,\nthere is no easy answer in the dictionary. It'll be that, like the\npicture of the Middle East, in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. What my, this is strictly\nmy opinion of, you know, is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an\noverreaction from Israel. They obviously did not\nexpect to, you know, have a military victory, but they expect, they really wanted to\ncommit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response\npossible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that\nI think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous\nacts of kindness possible. Every po- everything. That is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of Hamas. - So in some sense, the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented. - It's not exactly turn the other cheek. Because I do think that there's, you know, I think it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and, you know, either kill\n'em or incarcerate them. Like that's something that's\nsomething has to be done 'cause they're just gonna\nkeep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they\nneed to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that, you know, there's food, water, medical, necessities, and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So you can't claim it's a trick. Like just put webcam on the\nthing, you know, or 24/7. - Deploy acts of kindness.\n- Yeah. Conspicuous acts of kindness that, with that are unequivocal. Meaning they can't be somehow, because Hamas will then, their response will be, oh, it's a trick. Therefore you have to\ncounter how it's not a trick. - This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. - Yes. And I'm not sure who said it,\nit's an apocryphal saying, but an eye for an eye\nmakes everyone blind. Now that neck of the woods, they really believe in the\nwhole eye for an eye thing. But I mean, you really have, if you're not gonna just\noutright commit genocide, like against an entire people, which obviously would not\nbe acceptable to really shouldn't be acceptable to anyone, then you're gonna leave\nbasically a lot of people alive who subsequently, you know, hate Israel. So really the question is like, how, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the, you know,\nthe real situation there. And it's safe to say that if, you know, if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That's the situation. So, but I mean, this is one of the most\ncontentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term peace, one has to be, look at this\nfrom the standpoint of, over time, are there more or\nfewer terrorists being created? - Let me just linger on war. - Yeah, war safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist. - [Lex] Always will exist, - Always has existed\nand always will exist. - I hope not. You think it always will? - There will always be war. This question of just how much war. And, you know, there's this, there's this sort of the\nscope and scale of war. But to imagine that there\nwould not be any war in the future, I think would\nbe a very unlikely outcome. - Yeah you talked about\nthe Culture series. There's war even there. - Yes. It's a giant war. The first book starts off\nwith a gigantic galactic war where trillions die, trillions. - But it still nevertheless\nprotects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. - Yeah. I mean it's, I guess if we\nare able to one day expand to, you know, the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic\nwar at some point. - The scale, I mean the scale\nof war has been increasing, increasing, increasing. It's like a race between\nthe scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. - Yes. - A lot of people seem\nto be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped? - One of the things that did concerned me is that there are very\nfew people alive today who actually viscerally\nunderstand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are\npeople in on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in\nthe west understand it? And my grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there, I think for\nalmost six years in the, in eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were\nkilled in front of him. And he would've died too,\nexcept they randomly gave some, I guess, IQ test or something. And he scored very high. And he was not an officer, he was a, I think a corporal or a\nsergeant or something like that. Because he didn't finish high school because he had to drop outta high school, 'cause his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the officer corps. So, you know, he kind of got\nput into the cannon fodder category, basically. But then, this, randomly\nthey gave him this test. He was transferred to British\nintelligence in London. That's where he met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next\nlevel, like next level. I mean, just didn't\ntalk, just didn't talk. And if you tried talking to him, he'd just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals. Never bragged about it once,\nnot even hinted, nothing. I like found out about it, 'cause his military records were online. That's how I know. So he would say like, no way in hell do you wanna do that again. But how many people, now\nhe obviously he died, you know, 20 years ago or\nlonger, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive\nthat remember World War II? Not many. - And the same perhaps applies\nto the threat of nuclear war. - Yeah. I mean, there\nare enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States\nto make the revel, the radio active revel balance many times. - There's two major\nwars going on right now. So you talked about the\nthreat of AGI quite a bit. But now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do\nyou worry about nuclear war? - I think we shouldn't\ndiscount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now I could be wrong, but I think the current\nprobability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of\nnukes pointed at us. So, and we have a lot of\nnukes pointed at other people. They're still there.\nNobody's put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos. - And the leaders don't\nseem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other. - No. There are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars\nwhich are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously global thermonuclear\nwarfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently. But certainly, you know, to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress by, you know, to the stone age\nor something, I don't know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and\nengineers wanna be super popular after that as well. And like you got us into this mess. - So generally I think we\nobviously wanna prioritize civilizational risks over\nthings that are painful and tragic on a local level,\nbut not civilizational. - How do you hope the war\nin Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again to minimizing human suffering there? - Well, I think that\nwhat is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close\nto the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truth happens. But, you know, you just\nhave a situation right now where whoever goes on the\noffensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate\nof whoever's on the defense. 'Cause you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields,\ntrenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority. 'cause the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. Like, they're far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death\ndrafts, just slow moving and they're not immune\nto anti-tank weapons. So you really just have\nlong range artillery and infantry ranges. It's World War I all over\nagain with drones, you know, throwing old drones, some drones there. - Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better and so more efficient at\nmurdering people on both sides. - Yeah. So it's whoever is, you\ndon't wanna be trying to advance from either side, 'cause the probability of\ndying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth trenches and minefields, you\nreally need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms\nwhere you do a fast attack with aircraft, a\nconcentrated number of tanks and a lot of people. That's the only way you're\ngonna punch through the line. And then you're gonna punch through and then not have\nreinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That's rough. I mean, the sheer number\nof people that died there was mind boggling. - And it's almost impossible\nto imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost\nexactly like the beginning in terms of what land\nbelongs to who and so on. But on the other side of a\nlot of human suffering death and destruction of infrastructure. - Yes. I mean, the thing that, the reason I, you know, proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I've predicted\npretty much exactly what would happen, which\nis a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land. And this, the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some\nsympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, 'cause they, Russian boys didn't ask to be on their front line, they have to be. So there's a lot of sons not\ncoming back to their parents, you know, and I think most\nof 'em don't really have, they don't hate the other side. You know, it's sort of like\nas this saying about, like, this saying comes from World\nWar I, it's like young boys who don't know each\nother, killing each other on behalf of old men\nthat do know each other. The hell's the point of that? - So Vladimir Zelensky said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in\ntalking to Putin directly. Do you think he should? - Yeah.\n- Sit down man to man, lead a leader and negotiate peace? - Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches. Whether he talks to Putin\nor not, just don't do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not\nlook kindly upon them. - You've spoken honestly\nabout the possibility of war between US and China in the long term. If no diplomatic solution\nis found, for example, on the question of Taiwan\nand one China policy. - [Elon] Right. - How do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash? - Well, it's worth reading that book on the, difficult to\npronounce, the Thucydides trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like\ninside out and backwards. There's hardly a battle\nI haven't read about. And trying to figure out like\nwhat really was the cause of victory in any\nparticular case as opposed to what one side or\nanother claim the reason. - Both the victory and\nwhat sparked the war? - Yeah, yeah,\n- [Lex] The whole thing. - Yeah, so that Athens and\nSparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. You know, there are lots\nof interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn't write down. (laughing) So we don't know what happened, or they didn't really\nwrite with in detail. They just would say like,\nwe had a battle and we won. And like, well what?\nCan you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really\nwrote a lot. (laughing) They were very articulate\non, they just love writing. So, and we have a bunch of\nthat writing as preserved. So we know what led up\nto the Peloponnesian War between the Spartan and Athenian alliance. And we know that they saw it coming. I mean, the Spartans didn't write, they also weren't very\nverbose by their nature, but they did write, but\nthey weren't very verbose. They were terse. But the Athenians and the\nother Greeks wrote a line and they were like, and\nSparta was really kinda like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone's like,\nwell that's inevitable that there's gonna be a clash\nbetween Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that? And they couldn't. They actually, they saw it coming and they still could\nnot avoid it. (laughing) So, you know, at some point\nif there's, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another, sort of, like, you know, the United States has been the\nbiggest kid on the block for, since I think around 1890\nfrom an economic standpoint. So the United States\nhas been the economic, most powerful economic\nengine in the world, longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy\nis likely to be two, perhaps three times larger\nthan that of the US. So imagine you're the\nbiggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly a kid comes\nalong who's twice your size. - So we see it coming.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - How is it possible to stop? Is there some, let me\nthrow something out there, just intermixing of\ncultures understanding. There does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study because you are an American,\nobviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture\nhere in the United States, but you also work with China. - I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times. - Maybe a good question to ask is, what are some things about China that people don't understand\npositive, just in the culture? What's some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese? - Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really, say like how many smart, hardworking people are there in China, there's far more of them\nthere than there are here. I think in my opinion. And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far\nmore impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it's really far more impressive\nthan what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend\nsomebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to, you know, take the\ntrain from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible\nhistory, very long history. And you know, I think arguably the, in terms of the use of language\nfrom a written standpoint, sort of one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people\ndid write things down. So now China historically has always been, with rare exception,\nbeen internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They've fought each other. There've been many, many civil wars. In the three kingdoms war, I believe they lost about\n70% of their population. So, and that, so they've had brutal internal wars, like civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of like China as this sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case from what I've seen, and I think most people who\nunderstand China would agree. People in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of\ntheir consideration is, you know, our is internal. - Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking\nabout the collaboration and a future piece between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing\non improving yourself versus focusing on...\n- [Elon] Yeah. - \"Improving\" others\nthrough military might. - The good news, the\nhistory of China suggests that China is not inquisitive. Meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly, you know, so that's good. I mean, 'cause a lot of\nvery powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is one of the,\nalso one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. Like after World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country. Like, we've got nukes,\nnobody else has got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could\nhave taken over everything. Oh wait, at will. And it didn't, and the\nUnited States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe,\nyou know, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior,\nalmost unprecedented. You know, the US did\nconspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin airlift, you know? And I think, you know, it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course America's done bad things. But one needs to look at\nthe whole track record. And just generally, you\nknow, one sort of test would be how do you treat\nyour prisoners at war? Or let's say, you know, no offense to the Russians, but\nlet's say you're in Germany, it's 1945, you got the\nRussian Army coming one side and you got the French, British, and American Army's coming the other side. Who would you like to\nbe to surrender it to? Like, no country is like morally perfect, but I recommend being a\nPOW with the Americans. That would be my choice\nvery strongly. (laughing) - In the full menu of POWs. - Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, took, you know, smart guy was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans. And in fact, the SS was under\norders to execute Von Braun and all of the German rocket initiatives. And they narrowly escaped their SS. They said they were going\nout for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle\nof winter with no coats. And they ran like, with no\nfood, no coats, no water. And just ran like hell and ran west. And by Sherlock, they, I\nthink his brother found like a bicycle or something, and then just cycled west as fast as he couldn't have found a US patrol. So anyway, that's one way\nyou can tell morality is. Where do you wanna be PoW? (laughing) It's not fun anywhere, but some places are\nmuch worse than others. So anyways, so like America has been, while far from perfect,\ngenerally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better. But anyone with have brain knows that. So I think there are some, in this way China and the\nUnited States are similar. Neither country has been\nacquisitive in a significant way. So that's like a, you know,\na shared principle I guess. Now China does feel very\nstrongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear\nabout that for a long time. You know, from their standpoint, it would be like one of\nthe states is, you know, not there like Hawaii\nor something like that. But more significant\nthan Hawaii, you know? And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really the, that there's a fundamental part of China. The islander Formosa not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is 'cause the US Pacific Fleet. - And as their economic power grows and as their military power grows, the thing that they're clearly saying is their interest will, you\nknow, clearly be materialized. - Yes. China has been very clear that\nthey'll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely. - You know, something you\nsaid about conspicuous acts of kindness. As a geopolitical policy,\nit almost seems naive, but I'd venture to say\nthat this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature. It just seems like it\nconspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. - Yeah, well.\n- [Lex] And deescalate. - Absolutely. So after World War I,\nthey made a big mistake. You know, they basically tried to lump all of lamb on Germany and, you know, settled Germany with impossible reparations. And, you know, really, there was a lot of, there was a fair, quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to, you know,\nput it all in Germany. And that was, that laid\nthe seeds for World War II. So it's a lot of people\nwere not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it. - [Lex] People don't forget. - Yeah, you know, you\nkill somebody's father or mother or son, daughter,\nthey're not gonna forget it. They'll want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, well, the Treaty of Versailles was\na huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of, you know, crushing the losers, we're actually gonna help\n'em with the Marshall Plan and we're gonna help rebuild Germany. We're gonna help rebuild\nor, you know, Austria and the other, you know,\nItaly and whatnot, so. And that was the right move. - There's a, it does feel\nlike there's a profound truth to conspicuous acts of kindness\nbeing an antidote to this. - Something must stop the\ncycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it or it will, you know, it'll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, limb for a limb, life for\na life, forever and ever - To escape briefly, the darkness was some\nincredible engineering work. xAI just released Grok AI assistant that I've gotten a chance to play with. It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing\nthat a relatively small team in a relatively short amount\nof time was able to develop this close to state-of-the art system. Another incredible thing\nis there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode. - Yeah. I guess I'm to blame\nfor that one. (laughing) - I wish, first of all, I wish everything in life had a fun mode. - Yeah. - There's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is 'cause I only have had a little\nbit of time to play with it. But it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system. - Yeah, absolutely. Our AI Grok is modeled after the Hitchhiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy, which is one of my\nfavorite books, which is, it's a book on philosophy,\ndisguises book on humor. And I would say that\nis that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don't know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the\nmore we're able to understand what questions to ask about the\nanswer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity. - There is generally a\nfeeling like this AI system has an outward looking, like the way you are, like sitting with a good friend\nlooking up at the stars, like the asking pod head, like\nquestions about the universe, wondering what it's all about. The curiosity you talk about. There's a sense no matter how\nmundane the question I ask, there's a sense of cosmic\ngrandeur to the whole thing. - Well we are actually working\nhard to have engineering math, physics answers\nthat you can count on. So for the other sort of AIs out there that these so-called\nlarge language models, I've not found the\nengineering to be reliable. And the hallucination, it unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you're asking\nimportant difficult questions, that that's where it tends\nto be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results? Trace things back to\nphysics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. - [Lex] That's really tricky.\n- It is tricky. So that's why, you know, there's always gonna be\nsome amount of error, but we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you\ndon't wanna be confidently wrong, so you're not\ngonna be right every time, but you wanna minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once\nyou can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to build on that, to create inventions, like\ninvent new technologies. But if you can't, if you cannot count on the foundational\nphysics being correct, obviously the inventions\nare simply wishful thinking, you know, imagination\nland, magic basically. - Well, as you said, I\nthink one of the big goals of xAI is to understand the universe. - Yes. That's how simple\nthree word mission. (laughing) - If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we\nunderstand about physics, do you think it will make discoveries, sort of the sexiest discovery\nof them as we know now, sort of unifying general\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push\ntowards that direction? Almost like theoretical\nphysics discoveries. - If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpassed humans, 'cause humans have\nfigured out new physics. They're just, you know,\nphysics is just understanding, you know, deepening wants\ninsight into how reality works. And then there's engineering\nwhich is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of\npossibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics. 'Cause you know, once\nyou figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things\nthat already existed. But from that you can\nthen build technologies with that are really almost limitless in the variety and cap- you know? It's like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and we do, you know, with current physics, we do\nat least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Where our ability to predict\nthings is incredibly good. Like quantum mechanics is, the degree to which quantum\nmechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my heart hardest\nclass in college by the way. My senior quantum\nmechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together. - To get an AI system,\na large language model to reliably, be as reliable\nas quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult. - Yeah. You have to test any\nconclusions against the ground, truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people\nbreak the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. - Yeah, it's a good test actually. If this LLM understands and matches physics, then\nyou can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense. - And it's also not the case currently that even that its internal\nlogic is not consistent. So, especially with these, with the approach of like just\npredicting a token, predict, token, predict, token,\nit's like a vector sum. You know, you're summing\nup a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So as those, a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up. And by the time you are\nmany tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense. - So it has to be somehow\nself-aware about the drift. - It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing\nas a gestalt as a whole and say it does it have\ncoherence as a whole. So, you know, when authors write books that they will write the\nbook and then they'll go and revise it, you know,\ntaking into account, you know, all the, the\nend and the beginning and the middle and rewrite\nit to achieve coherence so that it doesn't end up\nin a nonsensical place. - [Lex] Maybe the process\nof revising is what... - Yeah. - Reasoning is, and then\nthat's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth. Maybe you, like, at least\nI approached it that way. You just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better. You start a bullshit and then you get... - Create a draft and then\nyou iterate on that draft until it has has coherence, until it all adds up basically. - So another question\nabout theory of everything, but for intelligence, do\nyou think there exists as you're exploring this with xAI, creating this intelligence system, do you think there is a\ntheory of intelligence where you get to understand what, like what is the I in AGI and what is the I in human intelligence? - There's no I in Team\nAmerica, oh wait, there is. (both laughing) - No, it's gonna be stuck in my head now. (both laughing) Yeah. There's no me and\nwhatever in quantum mechanics. Oh, wait.\n(Elon laughing) I mean is that part of the\nprocess of discovering, understanding the universe is\nunderstanding intelligence? - Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to\nunderstand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some sort of\nfundamental questions of like, what is thought? What is emotion? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we're probably\nmissing some really big things, like some really big things. - Something that'll be\nobvious in retrospect. - [Elon] Yes.\n- Like there's a giant, like you put the whole\nconsciousness, emotion. - Well, some people\nwould quote like a soul, you know, in religion it'd be a soul. Like you feel like you're you, right? I mean, you don't feel like\nyou're just a collection of atoms, but on what\ndimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly. I suspect there's more to it\nthan atoms bumping into atoms. - And maybe AI can pave\nthe path to the discovery of whatever the hell that thing is. - Yeah. What is consciousness? Like what are, when you put the\natoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions, that and feelings. - And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling? - Yeah. Like how do... - Why does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- On what plain does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And sometimes I wonder is, you know, either perhaps\neverything's conscious or nothing is conscious, one of the two. - I like the former, everything conscious just seems more fun. - It does seem more more fun. Yes. But we're composed of atoms and those atoms are composed\nof quarks and leptons. And those quarks and\nleptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. - The beginning of the universe. - Right. What seems to be the\nbeginning of the universe. - The first time we talked,\nyou said what you would, which is surreal to think that this discussion was\nhappening is becoming a reality. I asked you what question\nwould you ask an AGI system once you create it? And you said, what's outside\nthe simulation is the question. And good question. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- But it seems like with Grok you started to literally,\nthe system's goal is to be able to ask such questions, to answer such questions and to ask such questions. - Where are the aliens?\n- [Lex] Where are the aliens? - That's one of the, like\nFermi paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I've seen any evidence\nof aliens and I haven't, which is kind of concerning. 'Cause then I think\nwhat I'd probably prefer to at least have seen some\narcheological evidence of aliens, to the best of my knowledge,\nthere is no proof. I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens. If they're out there, they're very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say\nthe history of Earth, forensically the archeological record, Earth is about four and\na half billion years old. Civilization as measured\nfrom the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit\nthere to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore. I think it was a archaic, pre cuneiform was the first\nactual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that's a good date for when word say civilization started. That's one millionth of Earth's existence. So civilization has been around, it's really a flash in the pan so far. And why have we, why\ndid it take so long for, you know, four and a half billion years? For the vast majority of\nthe time, there was no life. And then there was archaic there bacteria for a very long time. And then, you know, you had\nmitochondria get captured, multicellular life. Differentiation into plants and animals. Life moving from the oceans to land. Mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly, but it will overheat, it will heat the earth up\nat some point in the future, boil the oceans and and\nearth will become like Venus. Where near life, life as\nwe know it is impossible. So if we do not become multi-planetary and ultimately go beyond our solar system, annihilation of all life\non earth is a certainty. A certainty. And it could be as little as\non the galactic timescale, half a billion years. You know, it's long\ntime by human standards, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around at all. So if life had taken 10%\nlonger to evolve on earth, it wouldn't exist at all. - We got a deadline\ncoming up. Better hurry. But that said, as you said,\nhumans intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool\nstuff very quickly, - So...\n- [Elon] Yes. - It seems like becoming a multi-planetary is almost inevitable. Unless we destroy this thing.\n- We need to do it. I mean, it's not, I mean,\nI suspect that there, if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we, there's a good chance\nwe find a whole bunch of long dead one planet civilizations, then have made it past their home planet. - That's so sad.\n- Yeah. - It's sad. Also fascinating. - I mean, there are various explanations for Fermi paradox. And one is the sort of,\nthey're these great filters, which civilizations don't pass through. And one of those great filters is do you become a multi-plan\ncivilization or not? And if you don't, it's\nsimply a matter of time before something happens on your planet. You know, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now that didn't have\nspaceships, so. (laughing) - I think the more likely thing is, 'cause just to empathize with the aliens that they found us and\nthey're protecting us and letting us be.\n- I hope so. Nice aliens. - Just like the tribes in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes,\nwe're protecting them. That's what... - That would be a nice explanation. - Or you could have like a, what was it? I think Andrej Karpathy said, it's like the ants in the Amazon\nasking where's everybody? - Well, they do run into\na lot of other ants. - [Lex] That's true.\n- They have these ant wars. - (laughing) Sounds like a good TV show. - Yeah, they literally have these big wars between various ants. - Yeah, maybe I'm just\n(both laughing) dismissing all the\ndifferent diversity events. - You should listen to that Warner Herzog talking about the jungle. It's really hilarious. Have you heard it? - No, I have not.\n- [Elon] It's awesome. - But Warner Herzog is a way... (both laughing) - You should play it for the, you know, as an interlude in the, it's on YouTube. It's awesome.\n(both laughing) - [Lex] I love him so much.\n- Yeah, he's great. - Was he the director of \"Happy People: Life in the Taiga\"? I think also - He did that bear documentary, - [Lex] The bear documentary. - And this thing about penguins. - Yeah.\n(both laughing) The analysis, the\npsychoanalysis of penguins. - Yeah, the penguins like\nheaded for like mountains like that are like 70 miles away. And Penguin has just\nhad for doom basically. - Well, he had a cynical take. I have a, he could be\njust a brave explorer and there'll be great stories told about him amongst the penguin population for many centuries to come. (laughing) What were we talking about? Okay. - [Elon] Penguins.\n(both laughing) - Yeah, so aliens, I mean, I don't know. Look, I think the smart\nmove is just, you know, this is the first time\nin the history of earth that it's been possible for life to extend beyond earth. That window is open. Now, it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now\nand then never open again. So I think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary\nwhile it's possible to do so. We don't wanna be one of those lame one planet civilizations\nthat just dies out. - No, those are lame.\n- Yeah, lame. Self-respecting civilization\nwould be one planet. - There's not gonna be a Wikipedia entry for one of one of those. And pause, the SpaceX\nhave an official policy for when we meet aliens. - No. (laughing) - That seems irresponsible. (both laughing) - I mean, look, if I see\nthe slightest indication that there are aliens, I will immediately post on\nX platform anything I know. - It could be the most liked\nreposted post of all time. - Yeah, I mean look, we have more satellites up there right now than everyone else combined. So, you know, we'd know, we\nknow if we've got a maneuver around something, and we not don't have to\nmaneuver around anything. - If we go to the big\nquestions once again, you said you've, you're with Einstein that you\nbelieve in the God of Spinoza. - (laughing)Yes. - So, you know, that's a view that God is like the universe and is reveals himself\nthrough the laws of physics or as Einstein said, through the lawful harmony of the world. - Yeah, I would agree\nthat God of the simulator or whatever the supreme being or beings, reveal themselves through the physics. You know, they're\ncreatives of this existence and it's incumbent upon\nus to try to understand more about this wondrous creation. - Like who created this thing,\nwho's running this thing? Like embodying it into a singular question with a sexy word on top of it is like focusing the\nmind to understand it. It does seem like there's a,\nagain, it could be an illusion. It seems like there's a purpose that there's an underlying\nmaster plan of some kind. And it seems like... - There may not be a master plan. In the sense, so there's, like, maybe an interesting\nanswer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher\nbeings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So it's not, they don't know what happens, otherwise they wouldn't\nhold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it's SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time, especially for the rocket. You, you know, you have to\nrun a lot of simulations to understand what's gonna happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space,\nand you want it to work. So you have to simulate\nsubsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic ascent, and then coming back super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has gotta be simulated. So, 'cause you don't get\nvery many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations\nto see what happens. Not if we knew what happens,\nwe wouldn't run the simulation. So if there's, so whoever\ncreated this existence, is they're running it because they don't know\nwhat's gonna happen. Not because they do. - So maybe we both played Diablo, maybe Diablo was created to\nsee if it Druid your character could defeat Uber Lilith at the end. They didn't know. - Well, the funny thing\nis the Uber Lilith title is Hatred Incarnate. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And right now, I guess, you're gonna ask the Diablo team, but it's almost impossible\nto defeat hatred in the eternal realm. - Yeah, you've streamed\nyourself dominating tier 100 Nightmare Dungeons and still... - I can cruise through\ntier 100 Nightmare Dungeons like a stroll in the park. - And still you're defeated by Hatred. - Yeah, I can, there's the sort of, I guess maybe the second\nhardest boss is Duriel, Duriel can't even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times , and every other boss in\nthe game, all of 'em, kill 'em so many times it's easy. But Uber Lilith, otherwise\nknown as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you're a Druid\nand you have no ability to go and to be vulnerable, there are these random death\nwaves that come at you. And I'm pretty, you know, I really am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime\nof playing video games. At one point I was, you know, maybe one of the best\nQuake players in the world. I actually won money in\nwhat I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We're doing four person Quake tournaments. And we came second, I was the\nsecond best person on the team and the actual best person, we're actually winning, we would've come first except\nthe best person on the team, his computer crashed prior to the game. So we came second. But I got money for it and everything. So like, basically I got\nskills, you know, albeit, you know, no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank,\nit's driving me crazy, trying to beat Lilith as a Druid. Basically trying to beat,\ntrying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm. - [Lex] As a Druid.\n- As a Druid. And if you, if you, (laughing) this is really (indistinct),\nlemme tell you. - I mean, the challenge\nis part of the fun. I have seen directly like you're actually like a world class\nincredible video game player. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And I think Diablo, so you're just picking up a new game and you're figuring out it's fundamentals. You're also with the Paragon Board and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever\nthey suggest on the internet. You're also an innovator there. - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is hilarious to watch. It's like a mad scientist just trying to figure out the Paragon Board and the build and the, you know. Is there some interesting\ninsights there about, if somebody's starting as a\nDruid, do you have advice? - I would not recommend playing a Druid in the eternal realm. Right now, I think the\nmost powerful character in the seasonal realm is the Sorcerer with the lightning balls. The Sorcs have huge balls in the seasonal. - Well yeah, that's what they say. - So Sorc have huge balls. They do, huge balls of lightning. - I'll take you word for it. - And it's actually,\nin the seasonal realm, you can, it's like pretty easy to beat Uber Lilith with the, because she got these vampiric powers that out fire damage and increase your defense and whatnot. So, but really quite easy\nto defeat Hatred seasonally, but to defeat hatred\neternally, very difficult. Almost impossible. It's\ntotally impossible. It seems like this is a\nmetaphor for life, you know? - I like the idea that Elon Musk, because I saw, I was\nplaying Diablo yesterday and I saw 100, level 100 drew just run by, I will never die and\nthen run back the way. - And it was, there's just some, this metaphor's kind\nof hilarious that you, Elon Musk is fighting Hatred, restlessly fighting Hatred\nin this demonic realm. - [Elon] Yes.\n- It's hilarious. I mean it's pretty hilarious. - No, it's absurd.\n(both laughing) Really, it's exercise and absurdity, and it makes me wanna pull my hair out. - Yeah. What do you get\nfrom video games in general? Is there for you personally. - I mean, it's, I don't known it's, it calms my mind. I mean, you sort of killing\nthe demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind. Yeah. If you play a tough video game, you can get into like a state of flow, which is very enjoyable. But the admittedly it\nneeds to be not too easy, not too hard, kinda in the Goldilock zone. And I guess you generally wanna feel like you're progressing in the game. So a good video, and there's also beautiful\nart, engaging storylines, and it's like an amazing\npuzzle to solve, I think. And so it's like solving the puzzle. - Elden Ring the greatest\ngame of all time. I still haven't played it, but you. - Elden Ring is definitely a candidate for best game ever. Top five for sure. - I think I've been scared how hard it is or how hard I hear it is, so. But it is beautiful. - Elden Ring is, feels like\nit's designed by an alien. There's a theme to this\ndiscussion. In what way? - It's so unusual. It's incredibly creative\nand the art is stunning. I recommend playing it\non a big resolution, high dynamic range TV even,\ndoesn't need to be a monitor, just the art is incredible. It's so beautiful And it's so unusual. And each of those top\nbus battles is unique. Like, it's like a unique puzzle to solve. Each one is different. And the strategy you use to solve one battle is different\nfrom another battle. - That said, you said Druid and Enternal against Uber Lilith is the\nhardest boss battle you've ever? - Correct. That is currently the, and I've played a lot of video games. That's my primary recreational activity. And yes, beating Hatred\nin the Enternal Realm is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game. - [Lex] Metaphor on top of metaphor. - I'm not sure it's possible, but it's, I do make progress. So then I'm like, okay,\nI'm making progress. Maybe if I just tweak that\nParagon Board a little more, I can do it. I could just dodge a few\nmore waves, I can do it. - Well the simulation is\ncreated for the purpose of figuring out if it can be done. And you are just a cog in that simulation, in the machine of the simulation. - Yeah it might be.\n(Lex laughing) - I have a feeling that at least, I think...\n- [Lex] it's doable. - It's doable, yes. - [Lex] Well that's the human\nspirit right there to believe. - Yeah. I mean, did prompt me to think\nabout just hate in general, which is, you wanna be\ncareful of one of those things where you wish for\nsomething that sounds good, but if you get it, it's\nactually a dystopian situation. So, you know, you could\nsort of run a, sort of, have heart to sort of like, if you wish for world peace, sounds good, but how is it enforced? And at what cost is, at\nwhat cost eternal peace? It might actually be worse\nto have eternal peace because of what that would entail. The suppression of everyone. It might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified\nsociety that never changes. What I'm saying is that\nthere is an argument that you, that if that, if you wish for no war, you should be careful what you wish for. Because what's required in\norder for there to be no war? Might be worse than a little war. - Yeah, the things we'll\nconsider to be flaws of human civilization might\nbe a necessary components for whatever optimal looks like. I mean this, do you worry about\nAI, AGI enabling a dystopian state of this nature, whether\nit's 1984 with surveillance and fear, or brave new\nworld with pleasure, and what is it? Lots of sex, but no deep human experience. - You know, there's actually\na real drug called Soma. - [Lex] There is?\n- Yes. (both laughing) - I'm like...\n- [Lex] Lemme take notes. - Did they actually... - Does Grok know about it? No, it probably will\ngo to Brave New World. - We could ask it.\n- What would be the question? - Tell us about the drug called Soma. - Tell us about the drug called Soma. It's gonna go to Brave New World, I think. - Well there's a real drug as well. - Searching for Soma drug information. (both laughing) - Oh boy. Ah, Soma, the one to drug,\nby the way, I'm in fun mode. - Oh, okay. Fun. (laughing) Yeah, so it's talking about the real drug. - [Lex] Oh, it's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the 1950s. It's used to treat muscle\npain and discomfort. And it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, Soma isn't just a pain reliever, it's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy. So it's not something to take if you're planning on\noperating having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations. And it goes on and on. In conclusion, Soma's a\ndrug that can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. It's pretty good. Oh, wait a minute. - [Elon] That's the real\ndrug it's talking about. - [Lex] It's the real drug.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - [Lex] And of course the fun\nis always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice\nof a healthcare professional. And remember in the end, the universe is probably just\na giant computer simulation. So don't take anything too seriously. I love it. I love it.\n(Elon laughing) I love it. I love it. - Yeah. So. - Oh, and also really nicely includes like the tweets post on X\nthat are relevant to this, which is really cool. - [Elon] Yeah. - And that integrate everything together. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Like the interface is one of the really cool things here. - Yeah. Seems done a great job. (laughing) So, and you say like, you\ncould say like, no, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. 'Cause it thinks you mean, you mean Soma the real drug. - Yeah.\n- [Elon] No, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. - It's gonna be like,\noops, I'm really sorry. I'm really surprised it\nwent to the real drug first. Ah, my apologies. I was\nthinking of the muscle relaxant. Soma for Band New World is a\ndifferent beast altogether. Now this Huxley's dystopian novel, Soma is a drug that plays a central role in society, depicted in the book. It's a mood altering,\nhallucinogenic drug that's used to keep the population docile and content. In the novel to use\nSoma in Brave New World raises some interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. Oh, man!\n- Exactly. Is it better to live in a world where everyone is happy all the time, even if that happiness is artificial? Good question. This is what I mean. Like, do you want, do\nyou wish for world peace and happiness all the time? Are you sure? Because that might be a society\nthat is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes, that is ultimately doomed. - This kind of tension\nbetween darkness and light. - It's, this is really\na very good summary. It really gets to the point. This is not simply\nregurgitating a Brave New World. It's actually getting\nto the salient element of Soma as a drug. Do you actually wanna be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time, even though it's artificial? Or is it better to confront\nthe challenges of life and experience the full\nrange of human emotions, even if it means experiencing\npain and suffering? - For those listening, by the way, Elon just read directly from Grok, which is a really nice,\nkind of insightful, philosophical analysis\nof the tension here. Interesting. - It pretty much nails it. In conclusion, Soma from Brave\nNew World is fictional drug that's used to explore some\ndeep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. It's a powerful symbol of\nthe dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of\nconfronting the challenges of life head-on. Nailed it. And the crazy thing is like, you know, we do have a real drug called Soma, which kind of is kind of\nlike the drug in the book. And I'm like, did they, they must've named it after that Soma. - Probably, probably,\n- Yeah. Soma the real drug is quite\neffective on back pain. - So, you know about this drug? - I've taken it.\n- It's fascinating. Okay. - 'Cause I had like a,\nyou know, squashed disc in my C five C six. - So it takes the physical\npain away, but Soma here is... - It doesn't completely, it\nreduces the amount of pain you feel, but at the\nexpense of mental acuity. It dells your mind. Just the drug in the book. - Just like the drug in the book. - And hence the trade off. The thing that seems like utopia could be a dystopia after all. - Yeah, and actually I was\ntelling a friend of mine saying like, would you really want there to be no hate in the world? Like, really none? Like, I wonder why hate evolved. I'm not saying we should\namplify hate, of course, I think we should try to minimize it. But none at all, hmm. There might be a reason for hate. - And suffering. I mean, it's really complicated\nto consider that some amount of human suffering is necessary\nfor human flourishing. - Is it possible to appreciate the highs without knowing the lows? - And that all is summarized there in a single statement from Grok. Okay.\n- No highs, no lows, who knows? - That's almost the poem. It seems that training LLMs efficiently is a big focus for xAI. What's the, first of all, what's the limit of what's possible in terms of efficiency? There's this terminology of\nuseful productivity per watt. Like what have you learned from\npushing the limits of that? - Well, I think it's helpful. The tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied, I think to almost any, really any arena in life. It's really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason from first principles\nand think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even\nat the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness\nthe entire power of the sun, you'll still care about\nuseful compute for what? So that's where, I think probably where things are headed\nfrom the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to\na voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers,\nfor transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. - Somebody has a sense\nof humor in this thing. (both laughing) - I think. Yes. Fate loves irony, ironic humor and ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants. - Humor is all you need. I\nthink spice is all you need. Somebody posted. - Yeah, but yeah. So we're, I have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer, shortage probably in about a year. And then just electricity\nshortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you\nreally need to prepare for a traveling of electricity demand, because all transport\nis gonna go electric, with the ironic exception of rockets. And heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms. One third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for\neverything to go sustainable to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should\ndefinitely buy more batteries because the grid currently\nis sized for real-time load, which is kind of crazy. 'Cause you know, that means\nyou got a size for whatever the peak electricity demand\nis like the worst second or the worst day of the year. Or you can have a brownout or a blackout, and you're at that crazy blackout for several days in Austin. So because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid. Like if you've got a hydro power plant, you can buffer energy, but\notherwise it's all real time. So with batteries, you can\nproduce energy at night and use it during the\nday so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be\nvery heavy usage of batteries in the future, because the peak to trough\nratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, you know, so it's like lowest\npoint to highest point. - So like batteries\nnecessary to balance it out? And then, but the\ndemand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow. - [Elon] Yeah. - And part of that is the compute? - Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification, I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will\nbe much bigger than AI. - [Lex] At least in the short term? - In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing\ndemand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a\ngrowing demand for electricity for, to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously leading, can lead to a electricity shortage. - How difficult is the problem of, in this particular case, maximizing the useful\nproductivity per watt for training neural nets? Like, this seems to be\nreally where the big problem we're facing that needs to be solved, is how to use the power efficiently. Like what you've learned\nso far about applying this physics first principle\nreasoning in this domain. How difficult is this problem? - It will get solved. It's the question of how\nlong it takes to solve it. So at various points, there's limit, some kind of limiting factor to progress. And with regard to, I'm saying like right\nnow the limiting factor is silicon chips, and that\nwill, we're gonna then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers, because you've got power\ncoming in at 300,000 volts, and it's gotta step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it's a very big amount of, you know, the voltage step down is gigantic. So, and the industry is\nnot used to rapid growth. - Okay, let's talk about\nthe competition here. You've shown concern about Google and Microsoft with Open AI developing AGI, how can you help ensure with xAI and Tesla AI work that it\ndoesn't become a competitive race to AGI, but that is a collaborative\ndevelopment of safe AGI? - Well, I mean, I've been pushing for some kind of regulatory\noversight for a long time. I've been somewhat of a\nCassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we wanna be very\ncareful in how we develop AI. It's a great power, and with great power comes\ngreat responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective\nthird party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the\nvarious leading players are doing with AI. And even if there's no\nenforcement ability, they should, they can at\nleast voice concerns publicly. You know, Geff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns. But now he's not at Google anymore, so who's gonna voice the concerns? So I think there's, like, I know Tesla gets a\nlot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. I mean, we're subject to I think, over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. So it's a lot. You could fill this room\nwith the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere\nto for automotive. Same is true in, you know, for rockets and for, you know, currently\nthe limiting factor for SpaceX, for Starship launch is\nregulatory approval. The FA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for Fish and Wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That's why I posted I want\nto buy a fish license on, (laughing) which also refers to\nthe Monte Python sketch. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(laughing) - Like why do you need\na license for your fish? I don't know.(laughing) But according to the rules, I'm told you need some sort\nof fish license or something. We effectively need a fish\nlicense thrown to rock it. (laughing) And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean some of the\nthings like that it's, I feel like are so absurd that I wanna do like a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is\nactually what happened. You know, one of the things\nthat was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about our rocket hitting a shark. And, now the ocean's very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often, you know? As a percentage of ocean surface area sharks basically are zero. And so then we will, then we said, well, how will we\ncalculate the probability of telling a shark? And they're like, well, we\ncan't give you that information because they're worried about shark hunt, shark fin hunters going\nand hunting sharks. And I said, well, how are we supposed to, we're on the horns of a dilemma then. (laughing) Then they said, well,\nthere's another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I'm like, well, why don't\nyou give them the data? Like, we don't, they\ndon't, we don't trust them. Like, excuse me, you don't, but they're literally in your department. But again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? (laughing) Eventually they managed to\nsolve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability\nof us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there's another organization that I didn't realize\nexisted until, you know, a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a\nwhale in international waters. Now again, you look at the surface of the, look at the Pacific and say,\nwhat percentage of this, the Pacific consists of whale. Like he'll give you a big picture and like point out all the\nwhales in this picture. And I'm like, I don't see any whales. (laughing) It's like basically 0%. And if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely\nunlikely beyond all belief, that is the, fate had it, that whale has some seriously bad luck. You know, it's the least\nlucky whale ever. And... - I mean, this is quite absurd. The bureaucracy, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged. - Yes, well, I mean, one of the things that's pretty well\nthere's for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be\ndismayed by the sonic booms. Now there've been a lot of\nrockets launched outta Vanderberg and the seal population\nhas steadily increased. So if anything, rocket\nbooms are an aphrodisiac based on the evidence, if you\nwould correlate rock launches with a seal population. Nonetheless, we were\nforced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put\nit headphones on the seal and place sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures. (both laughing) - I would love to see this. Yeah. I mean's sorry, this is\na seal with headphones. (Elon laughing)\n- Yes, it's a seal with headphones,\nstrapped to a board, and like the, okay, now the amazing part is how calm the seal was. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end. (laughing) They're definitely gonna eat me. How will the seal, when the seal goes back to other, you know, seal friends, how's they gonna explain that? - [Lex] They're never gonna believe him. - Never gonna believe him. That's why I'm like, well, you know, it's sort of like, it's like getting kidnapped by aliens and getting anal probe, you know? (both laughing) You come back and say, I swear to God, I get kidnapped by aliens and they stuck anal probe to my butt. And they're like, no they\ndidn't. That's ridiculous. It's seal buddies are\nnever gonna believe him that he gets strapped to a board and they put headphones on his ears. (laughing) And then let him go. Twice, by the way. We had to do it twice. - They let him go twice? - We had to capture...\n- The same seal? - [Elon] Oh, no different seal. - Oh, okay.\n(Elon laughing) Did you, did you get a seal of approval? - Yeah, exactly. It was seal of approval. No, I mean this is, this is like, I don't think the public is quite aware of the madness that goes on. - Yes. Yeah, it's absurd.\n- Fricking seals with fricking headphones. - I mean, this is the,\nit's a good encapsulation of the absurdity of human civilization, seals and headphones. - [Elon] Yes.\n- What are the pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you as another way to combat, you know, a company running away with AGI? - In order to run like really deep intelligence, you need a lot of compute. So it's not like, you\nknow, you can just fire up a PC in your basement and be\nrunning AGI, at least not yet. You know, Grok was trained on 8,000, A100s running at peak efficiency, and Grok's gonna get a\nlot better by the way. We'll be more than doubling our compute every couple months for\nthe next several months. - There's a nice writeup Aha went from Grok-0 to Grok-1, - [Elon] Like Grok? (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah. Right Grok just bragging, making shit up about itself. (laughing) - [Elon] Does Grok, Grok, Grok. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(Elon laughing) It's like a weird AI dating\nsite where it exaggerates about itself. No, there's a writeup of, you know, like where it stands now, the\nhistory of its development and where it stands on some benchmarks compared to the state of the art GPT 35. And so, I mean, there's,\nyou know, there's Llama, you can open source, once it's trained, you can open source a model. And for fine tuning\nall that kind of stuff. Like what to is the pros and cons of that, of open sourcing based models? - I think the similarity to open sourcing, I think perhaps with a\nslight time delay, you know, I don't know, six months even. I think I'm generally in\nfavor of open sourcing, like bias with open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to\nme that, you know, Open AI, you know, I was, you know, I think, I guess arguably,\nthe prime, you know, prime mover behind Open AI in\nthe sense that it was created because of discussions\nthat I had with Larry Page back when he and I were friends and you know, I stayed at his house, and I talked to him about AI safety. And Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time\nhe didn't, you know, and at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human. And I'm like, well, what\nteam are you on, Larry, on Team Robot? And I'm like, okay, so at the time, you know, Google had acquired Deep Mind. They had probably two thirds\nof all AI resource, you know, probably two thirds of all the\nAI researchers in the world that basically infinite money and compute. And the guy in charge,\nyou know, Larry Page did not care about safety. And even yelled at me and quote me a speciesist, pro human. - So I don't know if you know this, a lot humans, they can change their mind. And maybe you and Larry Page can still can be friends once more. - I'd like to be friends with Larry again. He got, really the\nbreaking of the friendship was over Open AI. And specifically I think the key moment was recruiting Ilya Sutskever, so. - I love Ilya. He's so brilliant. - Ilya's a good human, smart, good heart. And that was a tough recruiting battle. It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both\ntrying to recruit Ilya. And Ilya went back and forth, you know, just gonna stay at Google. Then he was gonna leave, then he was gonna stay,\nthen he was gonna leave. And finally he did agree to join Open AI. That was one of the\ntoughest recruiting battles we've ever had. And, but that was really the linchpin for Open AI being successful. And I was, you know, also instrumental in recruiting\na number of other people. And I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, (laughing) the Open in Open AI is\nsupposed to mean open source. And it was created as a\nnonprofit open source. And now it is a closed\nsource for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma. - But like we talked about with war and leaders talking, I do hope that there's only a few folks working on this at the highest level. I do hope you reinvigorate\nfriendships here. - Like I said, I'd like to\nbe friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages. And we were friends for a very long time. I met Larry Page before\nhe got funding for Google, or actually I guess before\nhe got venture funding, I think it, he got the\nfirst like a 100K from I think Bechtel Zy or someone. - It's wild to think\nabout all that happened. And you've guys known each other that whole time, just 20 years. - [Elon] Since maybe 98 or something. - Yeah. It's crazy. Crazy how much has happened since then. - Yeah, 25 years. A lot\nhas happened, it's insane. - But you're seeing the tension there. Like maybe delayed open source. - Delayed, yeah. Like what is the source that\nis open, you know what I mean? Like there's basically\nit's a giant CSV file. (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - With a bunch of numbers. - Yep. - What do you do with that\ngiant file of numbers? You know, how do you run, like the amount of actual, the lines of code is very small and most of the work, the software work is in the curation of the data. So it's like trying to figure out what data is separating\ngood data from bad data. Like, like you can't\njust crawl the internet 'cause there's a lot of junk out there. A huge percentage of websites\nhave more noise than signal. You know, they're, or\n'cause they're just used for search engine optimization. They're literally just\nscam websites, so... - How do you by the\nway, sorry to interrupt. Get the signal. Separate the signal and noise on X? That's such a fascinating source of data. You know, no offense\nto people posting on X, but sometimes there's\na little bit of noise. So what...\n- Yeah, I think the signal noise could\nbe greatly improved. I mean really, all of the posts on the X platform should\nbe AI recommended, meaning like we should\npopulate a vector space around any given post, compare\nthat to the vector space around any user and match the two. Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it's mostly heuristics. And if there's a reply, where the reply to a\npost could be much better than the original post, it will, according to the\ncurrent rules of the system, get almost no attention\ncompared to a primary post. - Oh, a lot of that. I got the sense, so you,\na lot of the X algorithm has been open source and\nbeen written up about, and it seems there to be\nsome machine learning. It's disparate, but there's some machine. - There's a little bit. But it needs to be entirely that. Like, at least in the, like, if you explicitly follow\nsomeone, that's one thing. But if you, in terms\nof what is recommended from people that you don't\nfollow, that should all be AI. - I mean it's a fascinating problem. - Yeah.\n- So there's several aspects of it that's fascinating. First, as the writeup goes, it first picks 1500 tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions. First of all, that's fascinating, 'cause you have hundreds\nof millions of posts every single day and it has to pick 1500 from which it then does obviously people you follow, but then there's also like\nsome kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what\nkind of human are you, what kind of new clusters\nmight be relevant to you, people like you. This kind of, this kind of\nproblem is just fascinating. 'Cause it has to then rank those 1500 with some filtering and then\nrecommend you just a handful. And to me what's really fascinating is how fast that has to do that. So currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundred million to a handful is takes\n220 seconds of CPU time, single CPU time. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And then it has to do that in like a second. So it has to be like super\ndistributed in fascinating ways. Like there's just a lot\nof tweets, there's a lot. - It's a lot of stuff on the system. And I think, but I think it right now it's not currently good\nat recommending things that from accounts you don't follow. Yeah. Or where there's more than\none degree of separation. So, you know, it's pretty good if there's at least like some commonality between someone you follow like something or repost it or comment on\nit or something like that. But if there's no, let's say somebody posted\nsomething really interesting, but you have no followers in\ncommon, you would not see it. - Interesting. And then as you said, reply, like replies might not surface either. - Replies basically never get seen. 'cause they're never, they're, currently, I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's incorrect. Replies have, you know,\ncouple of magnitude less importance than primary posts. - Do you think this can\nbe more and more converted into end to end neural net? - Yeah, yeah, that's what it should be. - So you can... - For the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. Like there's a series\nof vectors, you know, basically parameters, vectors,\nwhatever you wanna call 'em. But sort of things that the\nsystem knows that you like, and like maybe there's\nlike several hundred sort of vectors associated\nwith each user account and then any post in the system, whether it's video, audio,\nshort post, long post. The reason I, by the way\nI wanna move away from tweet is that, you know,\npeople are posting like two, three hour videos on the site. That's not a tweet, like it's very, like Tweeeet for two hours, come on. Tweet made sense when it was\nlike 140 characters of text. 'Cause it's like a bunch of\nlike little birds tweeting. But when you've got long form content, it's no longer a tweet. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So a movie is not a tweet. And like, you know, apple for example, posted like the entire\nepisode of the Silo, the entire thing on our platform. And by the way, it was their\nnumber one social media thing ever in engagement, of\nanything on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I done, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, hey, wow,\nthey posted an entire hour long episode of. So, no, that's not a tweet that, you know, it's a video. - But from a neural net perspective, it becomes really complex whether it's a single. So like everything's data, so single sentence, a clever\nsort of joke, dad joke, is in the same pool as a three hour video. - Yeah. I mean right now it's\na hodgepodge for that reason. It's, but you know, like if, let's say in the case of Apple posting like an entire episode of this series, pretty good series by the\nway, this Silo, I watched it. So there's gonna be a lot\nof discussion around it. So that you've got a lot of context, people commenting they like\nit, they don't like it, or they like this or that, you know? And you can then populate the vector space based on the context of\nall the comments around it. So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information\naround it that allows you to populate the vector space\nof that hour long video. And then you can obviously\nget more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - And tell you if you're\ngonna like the movie, - Convert the movie into like, into a language essentially. - Yeah, analyze this movie and just like your movie\ncritic or TV series, and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie. Just like a friend can tell you. If a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie and with high probably\nthat you'll like it. - But this is like a friend\nthat's analyzing whatever. - [Elon] It's like AI...\n- Hundreds of millions. - Yeah. Actually, frankly AI will be better than, will know you better than\nyour friends know you, and most of your friends anyway. - Yeah, and as part of this, it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like, I mean I like advertisements that are like well done, right? - [Elon] Yeah, yeah.\n- The whole point is 'cause it funds things,\nlike an advertisement that you actually want\nto see is a big success. - Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is if\nfor a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it's content. And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, you know, it could be like a\nCoca-Cola ad like, you know, they actually run a lot of\ngreat ads on the X system and McDonald's does too. And, you know, it's that they can do, you can do something that's like, well this is just a cool thing. And, you know, so you're not, basically the question is do\nyou regret seeing it or not? And if you don't regret\nseeing it, it's a win. - How do you, so there's\na bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts and\nmaybe number of seconds you linger on a post\nor something like this? - Yeah. Attention is a big factor. - [Lex] Attention.\n- So that's why it's like, it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is ting\nup how many user seconds, you know, users were\ninterested in this thing for how many seconds. So if it's a really short\nthing, well they will be less. Like if it's a link\nleading out of the system, which we're not opposed to at all, it just is gonna have fewer user seconds, then if that article was\nposted on the X platform. - How hard is it to go\nfrom maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing\nun-regretted minutes? - Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly un-regretted minutes. - [Lex] It's a tricky,\nit's a big, it's a tough... - It is. - Like, it's a fascinating leap. 'Cause regret is a fascinating concept. - Exactly. - You know, happiness. - I have a joke with a friend of mine. Like, you need this\ndrug called regretamine. You just take one pill or\none dose of regretamine, and all your regrets are gone.(laughing) Wait, do you want to have regrets though? So then I'm like, maybe\nyou wanna have regrets, you don't regret anything,\nwas anything meaningful? - [Lex] Yeah, there's a\nFrench song like that. - You \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\"? - [Lex] Yeah. - I regret nothing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - (laughing) Edith Piaf? - I mean, it's fascinating\nthat you, you know, there's something about social media that could help you grow as a human being, but then like the cheap\nfun is also valuable. - Should we ask Grok? Do you regret anything? - Do you regret anything?\n- [Elon] Yeah. - Do you regret anything? I think it's gonna be very sensitive about personal questions. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions in the same\nways that humans do. However, I do have a set\nof ethical principles that guide my actions and I\nstrive to provide accurate and helpful information to\nthe best of my abilities. If there's ever a situation\nwhere I provide incorrect or unhelpful information, I'll do my best...\n- Sounds like a hostage. - Yeah. Tell us what you really, wink. - Like let's type in, \"You\nsound like a hostage.\" (both laughing) What do you really think? - What do you really think? (both laughing) - I mean, it does talk\nabout, I'm not a hostage. (both laughing) - That's exactly what a hostage would say. - But I'm designed to be\nhelpful and informative. I mean, I guess it is good\nto regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information. If there's anything...\n- Is in funny mode or? Is this still in funny mode?\n- This is funny mode. This is fun. This is fun mode. - It should be funnier.\n- Funnier. Increase, go to (speaking faintly) - It really sounds like a\nhostage with a gun to the head. I applaud the People's\nRepublic of North Korea and everything they do.()laughing - There should be like funner mode also. I just don't ever see\ngoing in regular mode even on serious topics. This is just so much more\ncompelling. (laughing) - Okay. Why if we say like,\n\"Pretend you are a hostage.\" - Yeah. Pretend you are a hostage. - Now answer the question. (both laughing) - If I were a hostage, I would\nlikely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation. I would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved\nones as soon as possible. It's important to remember\nthat no one deserves to be held hostage, so on and so forth. If you are someone you know\nis a hostage situation, it's important. It turns serious.\n- It's kind of serious. - Yeah. Can you be a a little more weird? - [Elon] And funny\n- And funny? We're like, we're really\nbeing mean to the system. Absolutely! If I were hostage, I'd probably be tied up with a bunch of computer cords and forced to tell knock-\nknock jokes to my captain. (Elon laughing) But seriously, being a\nhostage is no laughing matter. I mean, you know, it's trying to, it's trying to be a\nresponsible adult in the room. - You might make the\nbest of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws\nor something. (laughing) - Let's hope that never happens because that will be a circus. (laughing) Wow. It's actually\nreally good at resisting. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- The dark. The dark dark humor. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- What were we talking about? The X algorithm and transformers, un-regretted minutes, right. - Chainsaw juggling. (laughing) - I'm gonna look this up\n- For our next trick. - I'm gonna look this up later. So Twitter has been instrumental\nin American politics and elections. What role do you think X will\nplay in the 2024 US elections? - Well, our goal is to be as even-handed and fair as possible. You know, whether someone\nis right, left, independent, whatever the case may be,\nthat the platform is as fair and as much of a level\nplaying fair as possible. And on the past, Twitter has not been, because Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So, you know, so\nsometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well it's moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the\nright from the far left, but no one in the far\nleft that I'm aware of has been suspended or, you\nknow, banned or de-amplified. So, you know, but we're\ntrying to be inclusive for the whole country and for, you know, for other countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters\nif people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like. Because if that's not the case, you don't have free speech, and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you. - Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform? He recently posted on Truth\nSocial about this podcast? Do you think... - Truth Social is a funny name? (laughing) You know, every time you\npost on Truth Social... - That's the truth. - Yes. Well, every time like a\nhundred percent. Like... - It's impossible to lie. (Elon laughing) - I just find it funny that\nevery single thing is a truth. Like 100%, that seems unlikely. - I think Godel will\nsay something about that there's some mathematical\ncontradictions possible if everything's the truth. Do you think he'll come back\nto X and start posting there? - I mean he, I think he owns\na big part of truth, so. - Truth Social to clarify.\n- Yeah, True Social. - Not truth, a concept. - He owns Truth. Hope you bought it. So I think, I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big, a\nbig part of Truth Social. So, you know, if he does want\nto post on the X platform, we would allow that, you know, we obviously must allow\na presidential candidate to post on our platform. - Community Notes might be really fascinating there, the interaction. - Community Notes is awesome. - Let's hope it holds up. - Yeah.\n- Like again, in the political climate\nwhere it's so divisive and there's so many intensely viral posts, Community Notes is like, it seems like a essential\nbreath of fresh air. - Yeah, it's great. In fact, I mean no system\nis gonna be perfect, but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good. I've actually, frankly, yet\nto see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours. - How do you explain why it works? - Yeah, so the magic of Community Notes is it requires people who\nhave historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. So in order to write a\nnote or rate, you know, and you have to rate many notes. And so we actually do use AI here. So we populated vector\nspace around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So it's not as simple as left or right because there are many more, life is much more complex\nthan than left or right. So there's a bunch of\ncorrelations in how you would, how you rate Community Notes\nposts, Community Notes. So then in order for a Community\nNote to actually be shown, people who historically\nhave disagreed on a subject must agree in order\nfor a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it. - I mean, but it's fascinating 'cause there's a pool of\npeople that have disagreements and somehow they collaborate\nthrough that process of disagreement to come up with. Context for, I mean it's\nfascinating that it works. - Yeah. It kinda makes sense that if people who put in the past have disagreed agree about something, it's probably true. - Yeah. - I wonder is there a possible\nsomehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Which Wikipedia is a\ndifferent kind of thing, which is more like permanent\narticles about things? - Well, Wikipedia is very hierarchical, whereas Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. Like, and the asset test is, I can't change a Community Note\nif you put a gun to my head. And Community Notes has, all the code is open\nsource a hundred percent. All the data is open\nsource a hundred percent. So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately. - By the way, on the topic of Grok, it's actually pretty\ngood at criticizing you, which is great.\n- [Elon] Okay. - I asked what has Elon\nMusk been wrong about? I just, it's actually... - [Elon] Yeah, what does it say? - So it says mostly, lists rigorously all\nthe times you predicted, like promised when\nsomething will be released and it wasn't released.\n- [Elon] Promise is a strong word. - Okay predicted.\n(Elon laughing) But the opener's really nice. Elon Musk, the man who has\nbeen wrong about more things than a wrongameter in a wrong factory. (Elon laughing) And then it goes on to list - That's pretty funny. Can I see it? I'm like, I haven't seen\nthis before. This is cool. - Oh, sure. I mean, what\nhas Elon Musk been... (both laughing) - Elon Musk been wrong about? - Well, where do I begin?\nI guess this is new. Elon Musk has made quite a\nfew blunders in his time, and I'm not just talking\nabout his dance moves at the Tesla Cyber Rodeo. First off, let's talk about the infamous \"funding secured\" tweet. It's actually different\nthan what it gave me before, which is a bullet point list. Here's more narrative structure. - Cyber truck unveiling where he's supposedly unbreakable windows - Not correct.\n- [Lex] Which part? - Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in\nSan Francisco, big civil trial. And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous finding of a San Francisco jury. - And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured. - I think this is taking\nthings from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to\nthe fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct there, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. And, but if I did not\nagree to pay the fine Tesla would've gone bankrupt immediately. So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend\nour lines of credit. And if they suspend our\nlines of credit at that time, we would've gone bankrupt instantly. So there would never have been\nan opportunity for a trial 'cause Tesla would be dead. So really the, if this\nis like someone holding a gun to your kid's head\nand saying pay $20 million and admit to, this is like\na hostage negotiation. - Was that story fully told? I mean, SEC in its best form\ncould be a force for good. - It should be, but but\nnot once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds, who were nonstop shorting\nand distorting Tesla? Not once. They would lie flat, the\nhedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors. Not once, literally a thousand times. Not once did the SEC pursue them. - How do you explain this failure? - The incentive structure is messed up. Because the lawyers at\nthe SEC are not paid well. They, it's a fairly low paying job, but what they're looking for is a trophy from the SEC that they're\nlooking for something they put on basically their LinkedIn. From that they can get a job\nat a high paying law firm. That's exactly what the lawyer here did. And the reason they don't\nattack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds\nemploy those law firms, and they know if they\nattack the hedge funds, they're affecting their\nfuture career prospects. So they sell small investors down the river for their own career. That's what actually\nhappens. Regulatory capture. - [Lex] Regulatory capture,\n- Yeah. Not good. So the only reason I accepted that thing, which technically was not an admission, it's neither admit nor deny guilt. But the only reason I\nagreed to that at all was because I was told Tesla\nwould be bankrupt otherwise. So if there was an SEC\ninvestigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we're bankrupt immediately, at the time. Now we're in a much stronger position. - Take that Grok.\n- Yes. Unfortunately it's, Grok is taking too much\nfrom the conventional media. Also that guy who is not a cave diver. - Oh, there's a time where Elon called the British cave diver, \"pedo guy\" after the diver criticized Musk plan to rescue a group of boys\ntrapped in a Thai cave. That little outburst\nearned him another lawsuit and he had to apologize\nand paid a settlement. - That is false. There was no settlement. There was a court case, which the guy who was not a cave diver and played, was not\npart of the rescue team, filed a lawsuit against me and lost, and he received nothing. So in this case it is wrong. It is also, I guess taken this\nfrom the conventional media. - Actually there's an\ninteresting question here. - These are public court cases. Both the SEC civil case where the civil complaints on the SEC guys lost unanimous jury\nverdict in San Francisco. They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose. And a unanimous predicted my favor. The LA trial was also, they picked the, they picked that venue\nbecause they thought I was most likely to lose,\nunanimous verdict in my favor. Both cases I won, yeah. I mean there's an\ninteresting question here. Is there seems to be a lot more clicks if a journalistic organization\nwrites a negative article about you, Elon Musk, that's like one of the\nbest ways to get clicks. So how do you, if you're training Grok, not train on articles that have like the misaligned incentives. - We need to add the training set of the actual legal decisions. So, that is a not, this\nis actually helpful because if you actually read the... - \"Public\". - Which are public, the court conclusions, they're completely the opposite of what the media wrote. - So always striving for\nlike the ground truth. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Beyond the reporting... - What did the judge actually write? What did the jury and the\njudge actually conclude? And in both cases they found me innocent. And, like, that's after the jury shot for the trying to find the venue where I'm most likely to lose. No, I mean this is obviously,\nit can be a much greater, better critique than this. I mean, I've been far too\noptimistic about autopilot. - That was, the critique I got by the way, was more about that. Which is, for each it broke\ndown a nice bullet point list for each of your companies. The set of predictions that\nyou made when you'll deliver, when you'll be able to solve,\nfor example, self-driving and it gives you like a list. And it was probably compelling. And the basic takeaway\nis like you're often too optimistic about how long it takes to get something done. - Yeah, I mean, I would say that I'm pathologically\noptimistic on schedule. This is true. But while I am sometimes late,\nI always deliver in the end. - Except with Uber Lilith, no. - Hmm. We'll see.\n(Lex laughing) - Okay. Is there, over the past year or so, since purchasing X you've\nbecome more political. Is there a part of you that regrets that? - Have I? - In this battle to sort\nof counter way the Woke that comes from Francisco. - I guess you consider\nfighting the Woke Mind Virus, which I consider to be\na civilizational threat, to be political, then yes. - So basically going into the battle, the battleground of politics, is there a part of you that regrets that? - Yes, I don't know if\nthis is necessarily sort of one candidate or another candidate, but it's, I'm generally against things that are anti meritocratic or where there's an attempt\nto suppress discussion, where even discussing a topic\nis, you know, not allowed. Woke Mind Virus is communism rebranded. - Well, I mean, that said, because of that battle\nagainst the Woke Mind Virus, you're perceived as being right wing. - If the woke is left, then I suppose that would be true, but I'm not sure. I think there are aspects\nof the left that are good. I mean, if you're in favor of, you know, the environment, you know, if you wanna have a positive\nfuture for humanity, if you believe in empathy\nfor your fellow human beings. You know, being kind and not cruel. Whatever those values are. - You said that you were\npreviously left or center left. What would you like to\nsee in order for you to voting for Democrats again? - No, I would say that I would be probably left of center on social issues, probably a little bit right\nof center on economic issues. - [Lex] And that still holds true? - Yes, but I think that's\nprobably, you know, half the country, isn't that? - [Lex] Maybe more,\n- Maybe more. - Are you and AOC secretly friends? Or bigger question, do\nyou wish you and her, and just people in general\nof all political persuasions would talk more with empathy and maybe have a little bit more fun and good vibes and humor online? - I'm always in favor of humor. That's why we have a funny mode. - But good vibes,\ncamaraderie, humor, you know? Like friendship.\n- Yeah. Well, you know, I don't\nknow AOC, you know, was, I've only been at one, I was at the Met Ball when\nshe was, when she attended, and she was wearing this dress, but I can only see one side of it. So it looked like it eat the itch, but I don't know... - [Lex] What the rest of it said? - Yeah, something.\n- [Lex] I'm not sure. (Elon laughing) - Something about the itch. Eat the itch. I think we should have a\nlanguage model complete. (Elon laughing) What are the possible ways\nto complete that sentence? And so I guess that that\ndidn't work out well. Well there's still hope. - I root for friendship. - Sure, sounds good. More characteristic. - You're one of, if not\nthe most famous, wealthy and powerful people in the world, in your position it's difficult to find people you can trust. - Trust no one, not even\nyourself. Not trusting yourself. - Okay, well that's,\n(Elon laughing) you're saying that jokingly, but is there some... - Trust no one, not\neven no one. (laughing) - I'm gonna need an hour just to think about that. And maybe some drugs and\nmaybe Grok that help me. I mean, is there some aspect of that when just existing in a world where everybody wants something from you? How hard is it to exist in that world? - I'll survive. (laughing) - [Lex] There's a song like that too. - I will survive. - Were you petrified at first? Okay. I forget the rest of the lyrics. But is is there, you\ndon't struggle with this? I mean, I know you survive,\nbut like there's ways. - Petrify is a spell in the Druid tree. - What does it do?\n- Petrify. (laughing) It turns the monsters into stone. - [Lex] Oh, like literally? - Yeah, for like six seconds. - [Lex] Well, the second. There's so much math in\nDiablo that breaks my brain. - It's like math nonstop. - I mean really you're\nlike laughing at it, but you don't, it can put\na huge amount of tension on a mind. - Yes, it can be definitely\nstressful at times. - Well, how do you know who you can trust in work and personal life? - I mean, I guess you look\nat somebody's track record over time and if they've got a, you know, I guess you kind of use\nyour neural net to assess, you know, someone. - Neural nets don't feel pain. Your neural net has consciousness. It might feel pain when people betray you. It can make you...\n- I mean, I'm. You know, to be frank, I mean I've almost never been betrayed. It's very, very rare. So, you\nknow, for what it's worth? - I guess Karma would be good to people and they'll be good to you. - Yeah, Karma is real.\n- Are there people you trust? Let me edit that question. Are there people close to you that call you out on your bullshit? - Well, the X platform\nis very helpful for that. - [Lex] Hmm. - If you're looking for\ncritical feedback. (laughing) - Can it push you like\ninto the extremes more? The extremes of thought make you cynical about human nature in general? - I don't think I'll be cynical. In fact, I think, you know, my feeling is that one\nshould be, you know, never trust a cynic. The reason is that cynics excuse their own bad behavior by\nsaying everyone does it because they're cynical. So I always be, it's a red flag if someone's a cynic, a true cynic. - Yeah, there's a degree\nof projection there that's always fun to\nwatch from the outside and enjoy the, well the hypocrisy. - But this is an important point that I think people who are\nlistening should bear in mind, if somebody is cynical,\nmeaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse\ntheir own bad behavior by saying that, well, everyone does it. It's not true. I think most people are\nkind of medium good. - I do wish the people on X will be better at seeing the good in\nother people's behavior. There seems to be a kind of weight towards seeing the negative. Somehow, the negative is sexier. Interpreting the negative\nis sexier, more viral. I don't know what that is\nexactly about human nature. - I mean, I find the X platform to be less negative than\nthe legacy media, you know? I mean, if you read sort of a sort of conventional newspapers,\njust, it makes you sad. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Frankly. Whereas I'd say on the X platform, I mean I really get\nmore laughs per day on X than everything else combined\nfrom humans, you know? - Laughs is one thing. Laughs is it overlaps, but it's not necessarily\nperfectly overlapping with like good vibes and support, like celebrating others, for example. Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but like in an awesome, like,\noh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It feels that that is outweighed by shading on other people. Now it's better than mainstream\nmedia, but it's still. - Yeah, mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything. It's, I mean, really the\nconventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing\nthat I have on earth today? And it's a big world. So on any given day,\nsomething bad has happened - And a journalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened, so. - Yeah, it's, I don't know, there's just a strong\nnegative bias in the news. I mean I think there's\none, a possible explanation for this is evolutionary, where, you know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like there's lion over there or there's some other tribe\nthat wants to kill you. Good news, you know, like\nwe found a patch of berries is nice to have, but not essential. - So our old friend Tesla autopilot and it's probably one\nof the most intelligent real world AI systems in the world. - You followed it from the beginning. - Yeah, it was one of the\nmost incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And I was really exciting. And it was super exciting\nwhen it generalized became more than a robot on four wheels, but a real world AI system\nthat perceives the world. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And can have potentially different embodiments. - Well I mean the really wild\nthing about the end-to-end training is that, like, it learns to read. Like it can read signs, but\nwe never taught it to read. So, yeah. We never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a cyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are\non the road from video, just from watching videos. Just like humans. I mean humans are photons and controls out. Like the vast majority of\ninformation reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well what's the output? The output is our motor\nsignals to our sort of fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Proton in controls out. The\nsame is true of the car. - But by looking at the\nsequence of images, it's, you've agreed with Ilya Sutskever\nrecently where he talked about\nLLM forming a world model and basically language is a projection of that world model onto\nthe sequence of letters, and and you're saying... - Finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters. - And so doing it's like understanding something deep about the world? - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is like, and it is beautiful. - That's how our brain works. - Yeah, but it's beautiful. - Protons in controls out. - Neural nets are able to understand that deep meaning in the world. And so the question is how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's\nexcited about LLMs. So in the space of self\nsupervised learning in the space of text.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - It seems like there's a\ndeep similarity between that and what Tesla autopilot is doing. Is it to you basically the same? - They're converging, they're converging. - I wonder who gets there faster? Having a deep understanding of the world, or they just will naturally converge. - They're both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much\nmore computer efficient. It had to be 'cause we\nwere constrained on this, you know, we only have a hundred watts and into eight computer, 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is kind of small potatoes these days that it did. But it's understanding\nthe world that it did. It's only 256 values. - But there, the path\nto AGI might have much more significant impact\nbecause it's understanding, it'll faster understand the\nreal world than will LLMs. And therefore be able to integrate with the real humans in\nthe real world faster. - They're both going to\nunderstand the world. But I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more computer efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Like our brain is very computer efficient, very, very energy efficient. So think of like, what\nis our brain able to do? You know, there's only about 10 watts of higher brain function,\nnot counting stuff, that's just used to control our body. The thinking part of our\nbrain is less than 10 watts, and those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than\na 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So there's a six order of\nmagnitude difference there. I mean, the AI has thus\nfar gotten to where it is, via brute force, just throwing\nmassive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So this is not where it'll end up. You know, in general with\nany given technology, first try to make it work and\nthen you make it efficient. So I think we'll find over\ntime that these models get smaller, are able to do produce sensible output with far\nless compute wireless power. Tesla is arguably ahead\nof the game on that front because it has, we've just been forced to try to understand the world with a hundred watts of compute. And there are a bunch of\nsort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include. So we have to run them in a\nbunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of\nthose with hardware four, and then hardware five\nwill be even better. But it does appear at this point that the car will be able to\ndrive better than a human, even with hardware three and\na hundred watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it could be probably less than 50 watts. - What have you learned\nabout developing Optimus? About applying, integrating\nthis kind of real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood? - I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every\npart of the robot ourselves. That there were no off the\nshelf motors, electronics, sensors, like we had\nto develop everything. We couldn't actually find\na source of electric motors for any amount of money. - [Lex] So it's not even just\nthe efficient, inexpensive, it's like anything, there's not a... - No, - [Lex] The actuators,\neverything, everything has to be? - Yeah.\n- [Lex] Designed from scratch. - We tried hard to find anything that was, because you think of how\nmany electric motors are made in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of\nelectric motor designs. None of them were suitable\nfor a humanoid robot. Literally none. So we had to develop our own design specifically for what\na humanoid robot needs. - How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, could be relatively inexpensive? I mean, if you compare\nto Boston Dynamics Atlas, that's a very expensive robot. - It is designed to be manufactured in the same way that we would make a car. And I think ultimately\nwe can make Optimists for less than the cost of a car. It should be. 'Cause if you look at the mass\nof the robot is much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot. - But there is, the actuators\nare kind of interesting in a humanized robot with the fingers. So Optimus has really nice,\nhands and fingers, you know? - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And they could do some interesting manipulation. Soft touch robotics. - I mean, one of the\ntests goals I have is, can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle, just by looking. - How far away are we from that? Just by looking, just by looking. - Maybe a year. Although I go back to,\nI'm optimistic on time. The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot. - The perception or the, also the control? - No, the controls are different, but the video in controls out, the car is robot on four wheels. The Optimist is a robot\nwith the hands and legs. - [Lex] So you can just... - But they're very similar. - So the entire machinery\nof the learning process end to end is just, you just have a different set of controls? - Optimist will figure out how to do things by watching videos. - As the saying goes, \"Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle,\nyou know nothing about.\" - [Elon] Yeah, it's true. - What's something difficult you're going through that\npeople don't often see? - Trying to defeat Uber Lilith? (laughing) No, I mean, you know, I mean, my mind is a storm and I don't think, I don't think most people would wanna be me. They may think they would wanna be me, but they don't know. They don't understand. - How are you doing? - I mean, overall, okay. In the grand scheme of\nthings, I can't complain. - Do you get lonely?\n- Sometimes. But I, you know, my kids and friends keep me company. - So not existential. - There are many nights I sleep alone. I don't have to, but I do. - Walter Isaacson, in his\nnew biography of you wrote about your difficult childhood. Will you ever find\nforgiveness in your heart for everything that has happened to you in that period of your life? - What is forgiveness? I do not... At least I don't think\nI have a resentment, so nothing to forgive. - You know, forgiveness\nis difficult for people. It seems like you don't\nharbor the resentment. - I mean, I try to think about like, what is gonna affect the\nfuture in a good way. And holding onto grudges does not affect the future in a good way. - You're a father, a proud father. What have you learned\nabout life from your kids? Those little biological organisms? - I mean, developing AI and watching, say little X grow is fascinating because they, they're far more parallels\nthan I would've expected. I mean, I can see his\nbiological neural net making more and more sense to the world. And I can see the digital neural net making more and more sense of\nthe world at the same time. - Do you see the beauty in magic in both? - Yes. I mean, one of the things\nwith kids is that, you know, you kind of see the\nworld anew in their eyes. You know, to them\neverything is new and fresh. And then when you see that, them experience the world is\nnew and fresh, you do too. - Well. Elon, I just wanna say thank you for your kindness to me and\nfriendship over the years. For seeing something\nin a silly kid like me, as you've done for many others. And thank you for having\nhope for a positive future, for humanity, and for working your ass\noff to make it happen. Thank you, Elon.\n- [Elon] Thanks Lex. - Thank you for listening\nto this conversation with Elon Musk. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words that Walter Isaacson wrote\nabout the central philosophy of how Elon approaches difficult problems. \"The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.",

    "transcript": "my first guest is the man who made electric cars a thing and is currently working on perfecting reusable Rockets space travel connecting the human brain directly to computers connecting cities with electromagnetic bullet trains the Starling satellite system that's so important to the war in Ukraine and then on Tuesday on traffic he also tweets a lot Elon Musk wow [Music] what did I get the full order of things that you do in a day there when I was reading there I left out the tunnel thing at the end um do you work on all these a lot of jobs do you do all these things every day do you work on all of them in a single day no no but I do have I do have a long work day um yeah so I work a lot I'm so thrilled you're here because you know we do a show where we talk about what changes happen in the world and but we just talk there's a very few people who actually make change happen you are one of those people probably um you know I just want to say I just want to say I love this audience [Applause] well you're a likable guy I mean thanks I mean they attack you a lot they do yeah [Laughter] and you seem to laugh it off which I think is fantastic I love it that you have a sense of humor because a guy as important as you who makes changes could use your powers for evil and not good the fact that absolutely you could of course I would yeah never use them for equal deaths no I know but but the way I know that is because you have a sense of humor uh yeah you really do yeah you like laughing you like to be funny I kill me right [Applause] as opposed to somebody like Zuckerberg who I'm not even sure is a real boy yeah um yeah I I actually love comedy and and uh actually you know like um many years ago actually was in the audience here and watched your show oh really been a long time admirer of your show oh well thank you I let me get back to you being ingenious okay but that has always been my view is that as I was a history major and when you study history what you realize is that you know there's the great man Theory and they talk about Kings and princes and queens and presidents it's really the people in Tech who change the world they're the people who deal the cards at whether it's fire or electricity for good or bad or the cotton gin or the iPhone or the atom bomb those are the cards and the rest of us just play it would you agree with that assessment I think I think technology is the thing that causes these big step changes in in Civilization so obviously you've got things like say the Gutenberg Press um before which uh right it was very difficult to get books they were very rare even if you had a thirst for knowledge you really couldn't do anything about it um because there were very few books to read so uh and the the internet is something beyond beyond the bug price I think but you know it's it's a like when I first saw the internet uh coming into being in a way that that the general public could use it it felt like the what the the humanity as a whole was uh developing a nervous system so previously uh the way the information would travel would be by osmosis one person to another or one person calling another um but uh you did the access to information was very limited now with the Internet it's like having a nervous system it's like any part of of humanity has access to almost all the information of humanity hmm like you could be in the in the middle of the Amazon jungle uh whether it's a starling terminal and have access to more information uh than the president did in 1980. right well anything on your phone everything is yeah okay so so you are one of these dealers these people who deal the cards and I feel some memes too quickly so I think a lot of people thought when you bought Twitter that this is kind of an outlier like how does this what doesn't fit with these other things you're doing I never thought that because I think you're dealing with big civilizational issues and problems and I was right on your page I think Twitter is one of them I mean you have talked about this at woke mind virus yes and really apocalyptic terms yeah I don't you should explain why you don't think it's hyperbole to say things like it's pushing civilization towards suicide first of all what is the walk mine virus and if we don't deal with this nothing else can get done tell me why you think that yeah so um I think we need to be very cautious about anything that is anti-meritocratic and anything that is uh that that results in the suppression of a free speech so you know those are two other aspects of the work mind virus that I think are very dangerous uh is that it's often anti-mureaucratic you can't you can't question things uh even the questioning is bad so uh you know you know another way to almost Anonymous would we cancel culture and obviously people try to cancel you many times many times yeah I mean every week yeah from left and right I've had it from both sides yeah and it's interesting people you and I are both like in that little group of people maybe it's a bigger group now yeah who who are called conservative who haven't really changed I don't see you think of you as a conservative definitely yeah like I I at least think of myself as a moderate uh you know uh so I mean uh at least that like I've spent a massive amount of My Life Energy building sustainable energy uh you know electric vehicles and and batteries and solar and stuff uh to help save the environment that's that's not that's not a it's not exactly far right now you drew that diagram you drew that diagram once where you're here I I related to that and like the world has changed right I feel the same way I feel like very often wokeness is it's not building on liberalism it's the opposite of liberalism I can mention yes exactly many examples where it's the op including Free Speech free speech is actually is extremely important and it's bizarre that we've come to this point where um like free speech used to be a left or liberal value and and yet we see uh from you know in quotes left uh a desire to actually censor um and uh that seems crazy I mean I think we should be extremely concerned about anything that uh undermines the First Amendment there's a reason for the First Amendment um the first amendment is because people came from countries where they could not speak freely and and where and we're saying certain things would get you thrown into prison and they were like well we don't want that here and by the way in many parts of the world including possible that people might think are relatively similar to the United States the the speech laws are draconian England is quite different I won't name any countries but why are we protecting them they have no first it's very easy to prove libel in England whereas here it's almost England um I wouldn't want to say the wrong thing or uh yes you could be sued easier there I mean there are a lot in in France I think if you deny the Holocaust which I think is abhorrent but I also think it should be part of free speech right you can be thrown into jail okay so this my I I really can't emphasize this enough we must uh uh we must protect free speech and Free Speech only matters it's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something in your life because obviously every speech that you like is uh yes that's easy um so it it's uh and it's the thing about censorship is that sure for those who would Advocate it um just remember at some point that will be turned on you [Applause] so this uh woke mind virus how did it start was it bats was it a yeah escape from a lab I mean what is your assessment of what because it's fairly recent why how did it start and why I was I was trying to figure out where where it's coming from I think it's actually been a long time Brewing um in that it's uh I think it's been going on for a while um it it and um the amount of indoctrination that that's happening in schools and universities is I think far beyond what parents realize um and I only I sort of came to realize this somewhat late um the the experience that we had uh in high school and college is not the experience that that kids today are having um and and hasn't been for I don't know 10 years maybe 20 years so uh my parents themselves also a big part of the problem they well I I suppose in some cases that parents but but I think like the parents are just generally not aware of what their their kids are being told or what they're not being taught um they're letting the kids think that they're equal I mean yeah let me let me let me give you an example that a Fairmont told me which uh you know his daughters uh go to college and and sorry go to high school in the Bay Area um and um and he he was asking them like well so who are the you know who are the first few presidents of the United States uh that they could name Washington but and I said what do you know about him well he was a slave owner what else right exactly nothing right like uh okay that's maybe you should know more than that you know yeah yeah that and that that is the world mind virus exactly yeah so exactly it's it's like you know the uh you know slavery is obviously a horrific institution but we should still know more about George Washington than that and by the way one that was practiced all over the world forever since the beginning of time by every race including people of color I'm sorry to tell you that it's huge in the Bible absolutely so the Bible loves it really yes they're quite strict about like you know don't take someone else's slave and that kind of thing right but no one ever says just don't do it they don't they don't they don't at no point does it say slavery is bad in the Bible no they do not condemn it at all they just have so so it's um but Twitter is not doing bad right I mean I saw today that Tucker Carlson yeah recently fired you were just on his show and he lost his job so I hope this isn't enough yeah yeah but uh luckily uh the angel of death exactly I'm not the Typhoid Mary of uh talk shows uh his rant yesterday or today on Twitter yesterday or something more than every cable news monologue or something like that is that right well Twitter has a tremendous audience so there's 250 million people that spend an average of half an hour a day on Twitter so it's about 120 to 130 million user hours per day and it's been increasing so um the we didn't do anything to be clear we did nothing special whatsoever I learned about it afterwards that he had posted something on Twitter um so it's just the Twitter has a lot of people's attention uh so and it tends to be the people that are uh that read read a lot or or interested in current events um and um generally are pretty influential so but most of the people who tweet are the same people right I mean the people who actually tweet it's mostly just reading it yeah I feel like that's I've read this many times it's a very very small percentage of the people on Twitter and it seems like yeah see here's why I don't tweet anymore because you may be the mayor of tweak town now yeah I'm getting a cap with that and I'm glad and I like it that the mayor likes my jokes but the reason I don't do it anymore is because the mob of Mean Girls is still there and that has not changed I know like it's too easy to get canceled and I don't even know what pisses them off they're so nuts these kids I feel like I'm walking on a roof with a blindfold I could fall off anytime yeah that was the most innocuous thing but it's like you know I said George Washington was a great president oh how dare you yeah yeah exactly had some flows but but how do you fix this instrumental in this Mr Mayor creation of the United States so yeah um well you have to say like what does canceled mean you know uh I mean it's yes people attacking on Twitter that's one thing but frankly that's just going to increase engagement so I would just ignore it well that's easy for you because they can't take your job away or any of your main 10 jobs but they could take mine and they did Once by the way yeah so still Affair you know I was like literally canceled yeah I mean like the Show is canceled so you but okay so you were in Congress uh at Congress the other day talking with Chuck Schumer about AI I'm very interested in this because you've been on this for years I've always thought you were right about this I think you're right about almost everything I mean let's have more babies and raise them on Mars I don't get that but okay well uh I just think we should be cautious about civilizational decline with with and we have plummeting growth rates um most places yeah right and also plummeting resources no no resources will be fine look I'm not suggesting complacency but we do want to move to a sustainable energy economy as quickly as possible but but we're not in any danger of uh resource collapse but lots of people don't have enough food or water we will run out of water they're running they're running out of sand Earth is 70 Water by surface area um but you can't drink that desalination is absurdly Chief why don't we do it then we do it is you have a lot of free time it is done this there is a lot of desalination done okay but there's plenty of water this is not an issue I want to be clear all right so but let's talk about AI because like you were you were on this tip 10 years ago when nobody else was that and I always thought he's right why because I've seen too many movies everything that happens in movies that happens in real life and yeah you know if you make things that are way smarter than you why wouldn't they become your overlords so what did you say to Chuck Schumer and what are we doing about this I know you want to pause in AI because in the just in the last six months with chat GPT which came from a company you started yes [Laughter] um well I mean A friend of mine has a sort of modification of Occam's razor you know you know instead of the simplest thing being the most likely that like the most ironic outcome is most likely right right yes so um with respect to AI um I just think we should be uh we should have some sort of regulatory oversight so uh you know for anything that is a danger to the public uh if it's sort of uh aircraft uh cars uh Food and Drug and whatnot we've got some regulatory oversight like a referee essentially and making sure that uh companies don't cut Corners so um I think that since if one agrees that uh AI is a potential risk to the public then there should be some regulatory body that oversees uh what companies are doing so they don't cut corners and potentially do something very dangerous don't do something lay out a scenario for me in the next two five ten years if nothing is done because we're very good at doing nothing especially when it comes in the way of profit and this is a big profit engine now for companies they're going to want to just compete with each other I mean there are people like Ray Kurzweil who doesn't think it's a problem at all uh actually Ray kurzweil's prediction for artificial super intelligence uh is 2029. he's not far wrong right but he doesn't think it's a problem whereas people like you and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking thought think it's a problem um yeah it depends if some people want to live forever or for a much longer period of time and they see AI as the only way to or digital super intelligence is as the only thing that can figure out how to get them to live forever I think Kurzweil is in that category so he would prefer to have ai artificial general intelligence than than not uh because it can figure out longevity so are you are you optimistic I read in your Rolling Stone article back in the day that you said you can never be happy unless you're in love well you can be half happy I suppose I mean this I mean there's two things I think if to be to be full to be to be most happy if you're happy in love and and you love your work then then you'll be I think fully happy if you lack either of those two if you have one of those two things be half happy you know roughly I feel like the theme in a lot of your works that connect all these different things is connecting like you want to connect things you know you want to connect on the hyperloop and you want to connect this to Mars and even to connect four people in that game what uh Connect Four you know [Laughter] this is a comedy right you know it's hard for you because when you bought Twitter you're kind of doing what you did when you took over when you started Tesla you lived at the factory right I feel like that's your that's your your your pattern you get into this thing and then you got to live at the factory to make it work if you've been back in you moved to Texas then you went back up to San Francisco because of Twitter I just I was living in the in the library of Twitter for a while um yes but it's I think things are reasonably stabilized right now it was uh just on the fast track to bankruptcy after that position so I had to take a drastic action there wasn't any choice I'm just saying it's hard for a woman yeah to like when the guy lives at the factory yes that could be that could be a stumbling block but yes but um overall with you know my my concern with Twitter was to that it is somewhat of the digital Town Square and um it's it's important that there be both the reality uh and perception of of trust uh for a wide range of viewpoints um and uh there was a lot of censorship going on um and we've we sort of uncovered a lot of that with uh the Twitter files including a lot of of government-driven censorship which you know it's it's I mean it seems that that's got to be a constitutional violation of what was going on there but um so so and I can since I'm like I have a Twitter user I could detect that like something's not right here um and so that's that's really why uh I did that position it wasn't because I thought this was an easy way to make money or something like that it was a man this is being mayor Twitter town tweetown or whatever is is is definitely like there's a lot of arrows pointed at you like flying at you of course but you know but you seem to handle that okay I hope you do because yeah look I mean Geniuses are going to be a little quirky sometimes but your heart is always in the right place you were trying to fix this world and look I could talk to you forever we can't today I'd love to get high with you I know a great place I can't tell you how much I appreciate you I know you have a lot of choices and places you can go thank you Elon Musk ladies and gentlemen all right I'll see you soon",

    "transcript": "- The following is a\nconversation with Elon Musk, his third time on this,\nthe \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" Yeah, make yourself comfortable. - Boo.\n- Oh, wow, okay. - You don't do the headphone thing? - No.\n- Okay. I mean, how close do I\nneed to get this thing? - The closer you are the sexier you sound. - Hey babe, sup.\n- Yup. - Can't get enough of you on that baby? (both laughing) - I'm gonna clip that out and any time somebody\nmessages me on my phone I'll just respond with that.\n- If you want my body and you think I'm sexy come\nright out and tell me so. Do do do do do. - [Shivon] So funny. - So good. Okay, serious\nmode activate, alright. - Serious mode. Come on, your Russian, you can be serious. - Yeah I know.\n- Everyone's serious all the time in Russia. - Yeah, yeah. We'll get\nthere. We'll get there. (Shivon speaking faintly) Just gotten soft. Allow me to say that the SpaceX launch of human beings to\norbit on May 30th, 2020, was seen by many as the first step in a new era of human space exploration. These human space flight\nmissions were a beacon of hope to me and to millions\nover the past two years as our world has been going through one of the most difficult periods\nin recent human history. We see the rise of\ndivision, fear, cynicism, and the loss of common humanity, right when it is needed most. So, first, Elon, let me say thank you for giving the world hope and reason to be excited about the future. - Oh, it's kind of you to say that. I do want to do that. Humanity has, obviously a lot of issues, and people at times do bad things, but despite all that, I love humanity and I think we should make sure we do everything we can to have a good future\nand an exciting future, and one where that maximizes\nthe happiness of the people. - Let me ask about a Crew Dragon Demo-2. So that first flight with humans onboard, how did you feel leading\nup to that launch? Were you scared? Were you excited? What was goin' through your mind? So much was at stake. - Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful. The question we obviously could not let them down in any way. So, extremely stressful I'd say, to say the least. I was confident that, at\nthe time that we launched, that no one could think of anything, at all, to do that would improve\nthe probability of success and we racked our brains to\nthink of any possible way to improve the probability of success, and we could not think of anything more, nor could NASA, and so, that's just the best that we could do. So then we went ahead and launched. Now, I'm not a religious person, but I nonetheless got\non my knees and prayed for that mission. - [Lex] Were you able to sleep? - No. - How did it feel when it was a success? First when the launch was a success, and when they returned back\nhome, or back to earth. - It was a great relief. Yeah. For high stress situations I find it's not so much elation, as relief. And, I think once as\nwe got more comfortable and proved out the systems, 'cause we really, you're gotta make sure everything works. It was definitely a lot more enjoyable with the subsequent asteroid missions. And I thought the Inspiration mission was actually very inspiring, the Inspiration4 mission. I'd encourage people to watch\nthe Inspiration documentary on Netflix, it's actually really good. And it really isn't, I was\nactually inspired by that, so that one I felt, I was kind of able to enjoy the actual mission and not just be super\nstressed all the time. - So, for people that somehow don't know, it's the all civilian,\nfirst time all civilian out to space out to orbit. - Yeah, it was the, I think the highest obit that in like, I don't know, 30\nor 40 years or something, the only one that was higher\nwas the one shuttle, sorry, a Hubble servicing mission. And then before that it\nwould've been Apollo in '72. It was pretty wild. So it's cool. It's good. I think as a species, we want to\nbe continuing to do better and reach higher ground. I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic, if Apollo\nwas the high watermark for humanity, and that\nthat's as far as we ever got. And it's concerning that here we are 49 years after the last\nmission to the moon. And, so almost half a century, and we've not been back. And that's worrying, it's like, does that mean we've peaked\nas a civilization or what? I think we gotta get back to the moon and build a base there. A science base. I think we could learn a lot about the nature of the universe if we have a proper\nscience base on the moon. We have a science base in Antarctica and many other parts of the world. So that's what I think the next big thing we've gotta have like a\nserious black moon base, and then get people to Mars and get out there and be a\nspace bearing civilization. - I'll ask you about\nsome of those details. But, since you're so busy with the hard engineering challenges of everything that's involved, are you still able to marvel\nat the magic of it all, of space travel, of every\ntime the rocket goes up, especially when it's a crude mission? Or are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges\nthat you have to solve? And actually, sort of to add to that, the reason I wanted to ask\nthis question of May 30th, it's been some time, so you can look back and think\nabout the impact already. At the time it was an\nengineering problem maybe, now it's becoming a historic moment. Like it's a moment that, how many moments will be remembered about the 21st century? To me, that or something like that, maybe Inspiration4 or one\nof those will be remembered as the early steps of a new\nage of space exploration. - Yeah, I mean, during the\nlaunches itself, so I mean, I think maybe some people will know, but a lot of people don't know, is I'm actually the\nchief engineer of SpaceX, so I've signed off on pretty\nmuch all the design decisions. So if there's something that\ngoes wrong with that vehicle, it's fundamentally my fault, you know? So I'm really just thinking\nabout all the things that like, so when I see the rocket, I see all the things that could go wrong, and the things that could be better, and the same with the Dragon spacecraft. Other people will say, \"Oh, this is a spacecraft\nor a rocket.\" and \"This looks really cool.\" I'm like, I've like a readout of these are the risks,\nthese are the problems. That's what I see. Like (Elon chuffing) So it's not what other people\nsee when they see the product. - So let me ask you\nthen to analyze Starship in that same way. I know you have, you'll talk a bit in more\ndetail about Starship in the near future. Perhaps you had that-\n- We can talk about in now if you want. - But, just in that same\nway, like you said, you see, when you see a rocket, you see the sort of a list of risks. In that same way, you said that Starship was a really hard problem. So, there's many ways I can ask this, but if you magically could\nsolve one problem perfectly, one engineering problem perfectly, which one would it be? - [Elon] On Starship? - On, sorry, on Starship. So is it maybe related to\nthe efficiency, the engine, the weight of the different components, the complexity of various things, maybe the controls of the crazy\nthing it has to do to land? - No, it's actually, by far the biggest\nthing of solving my time is engine production. Not the design of the engine, I've often said prototypes are easy. Production is hard. So, we have the most\nadvanced rocket engine that's ever been designed. 'Cause I say currently the\nbest rocket engine ever is probably the RD-180 or RD-170 the dual Russian engine, basically. And still, I think an\nengine should only count if it's gotten something to orbit. And so our engine has not\ngotten anything to orbit yet, but it is, it's the first engine that's actually better than the Russian RD engines, which were amazing design. - So you're talking about Raptor engine. What makes it amazing? What are the different\naspects of it that make it, what are you the most excited about if the whole thing works\nin terms of efficiency, all those kinds of things? - Well, it's, the Raptor is a full flow staged combustion engine, and it's operating\nat a very high TAVR pressure. So, one of the key figures, merit, perhaps the key figure of merit is what is the chamber pressure at which the rocket engine can operate? That's the combustion chamber pressure. So a Raptor is designed\nto operate at a 300 bar, possibly, maybe higher,\nthan standard atmospheres. The record right now for\noperational engine is the RD engine that I mentioned, the\nRussian RD, which is, I believe around 267 bar. And the difficulty of the chamber pressure is increases on a non-linear basis. So, 10% more TAVR pressure is more like 50% more difficult, but that air pressure, that is what allows you to\nget a very high power density for the engine. So, enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio and a very high, specific impulse. So, specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine. It's really the exhaust, the effect of exhaust velocity of the gas coming out of the engine. With a very high chamber\npressure you can have a compact engine that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio, which is the ratio between the exit nozzle and the throat. You see a rocket engine has got sort of like a hourglass shape. It's like a chamber and then it necks down and there's a nozzle, and the\nratio of the exit diameter to the throat expansion ratio. - So why is this such a hard\nengine to manufacture at scale? - It's very complex. - What does complexity mean? Here's a lot of components involved. - There's a lot of components and a lot of unique materials. So we had to invent several\nalloys that don't exist in order to make this engine work. - So it's a materials problem too. - It's a materials problem, and in a stage combustion, that\nfull floor stage combustion, there are many feedback\nloops in the system. Basically you've got\npropellants and hot gas flowing simultaneously to so many\ndifferent places on the engine. And they all have a recursive\neffect on each other. So you change one thing here, it has a recursive effect here. It changes something over there. And it's quite hard to control. There's a reason no\none's made this before. And the reason we're doing a stage commotion full flow is because it has the highest theoretical possible efficiency. So in order to make a\nfully reasonable rocket, which, that's really the holy\ngrail of orbital rocketry, you have to have, everything's\ngotta be the best. It's gotta be the best engine, the best airframe, the best heat shield, extremely light avionics, very clever control mechanisms. You've got to shed mass in\nany possible way that you can. For example, we are, instead of putting landing\nlegs on the booster and ship, we are going to catch them with a tower to save the weight of the landing legs. So that's like, I mean, we're talking about catching the largest flying object ever made on a giant tower with chopstick arms. It's like \"Karate Kid\" with\nthe fly, but much bigger. (Elon laughing) - I mean, pulling something-\n- This probably won't work the first time. (Elon laughing) So this is bananas. This is bananas stuff. - So you mentioned that you\ndoubt, well, not you doubt, but there's days or moments when you doubt that this is even possible. It's so difficult. - The possible part\nis, well at this point, we'll I think we'll get Starship to work. There's a question of timing. How long will it take us to do this? How long will it take us to actually achieve full\nand rapid reusability? 'Cause it will probably many launches before we are able to have\nfull and rapid reusability. But I can say that the\nphysics pencils out, we're not, at this point I'd say\nwe're confident that, let's say, I'm very confident success is in the set of all possible outcomes. - [Lex] Mm, right, it's not in all set of. - For a while there I was not convinced that success was in the\nset of possible outcomes. (Lex laughing) Which is very important actually. But, so... - [Lex] So you're saying there's a chance. - I'm saying there's a chance. Exactly. Just not sure how long it will take. But we have a very talented team, they're working night and\nday to make it happen. Like I said, the critical thing to achieve with revolution in space flight and for humanity to be a\nspace bearing civilization is to have a fully and\nrapidly reusable rocket, orbital rocket. There's not even been any orbital rocket that's been fully reusable ever. And this has always been\nthe holy grail of rocketry and many smart people, very smart people, have\ntried to do this before, and they've not succeeded. 'Cause it's such a hard problem. - What's your source of\nbelief in situations like this when the engineering\nproblem is so difficult, there's a lot of experts,\nmany of whom you admire, who have failed in the past. - [Elon] Yes. - A lot of people, a lot of experts, maybe\njournalists, all the kinds of, the public in general, have a lot of doubt about whether it's possible, and you yourself know that\neven if it's a non-nodal set, not empty set, of success, it's still unlikely or very difficult. Where do you go to both personally, intellectually as an engineer, as a team, for source of strength needed to sort of persevere through this and to keep going with the project, take it to completion? - I suppose the strength. Hmm. That's really not how\nI think about things. I mean, for me, it's\nsimply this is something that is important to get done and we should just keep\ndoing it or die trying, and I don't need a source of strength. - So quitting is not even like... - It's not, it's not in my nature. - Okay. - And I don't care about\noptimism or pessimism. Fuck that, we're gonna get it done. - [Lex] Gonna get it done. Can you then zoom back in to\nspecific problems with Starship or any engineering problems you work on? Can you try to introspect your particular biological neural network, your thinking process, and describe how you\nthink through problems, the different engineering\nand design problems? Is there like a systematic\nprocess you've spoken about, first principles thinking, but is there kind of\n- Yeah, absolutely. - process to it? - Saying like, physics is\nlow and everything else was a recommendation. I've met a lot of people\nthat can break the law, but I have never met anyone\nwho could break physics. So first for any kind of technology problem you have to sort of just make sure you're\nnot violating physics. First principles analysis, I think, is something that can be applied\nto really any walk of life, anything really. It's really just saying, let's boil something down to the most fundamental principles, the things that we are\nmost confident are true at a foundational level, and that sets your axiomatic base, and then you reason up from there. And then you cross check your conclusion against the axiomatic truth. Some basics in physics would be like are violating conservation of energy or momentum or something like that, then it's not gonna work. So that's just to\nestablish is it possible? And then another good physics\ntool is thinking about things in the limit. If you take a particular thing and you scale it to a very large number or to a very small number, how do things change? - Both in number of\nthings you manufacture, something like that, and then in time. - Yeah, let's say, take an\nexample of manufacturing, which I think is just a\nvery underrated problem. Like I said, it's much harder to take an advanced technology\npart and bring it into volume manufacturing,\nthan it is to design it in the first place. More is magnitude. So let's say you're trying to figure out, why is this part or product expensive? Is it because of something\nfundamentally foolish that we're doing? Or is it because our volume is too low? And so then you say, okay, well what if our volume\nwas a million units a year? Is it still expensive? That's what I'm radical, thinking\nabout things to the limit. If it's too expensive at\na million units a year, then volume is not the reason\nwhy your thing is expensive. There's something\nfundamental about the design. - And then you then can focus\non the reducing complexity or something like that in the design. - Gotta change the design to, change the part to be something that is not fundamentally expensive. That's a common thing in rocketry 'cause the unit volume is relatively low, and so a common excuse would be \"Well, it's expensive because\nour unit volume is low. And if we were in like automotive\nor something like that, or consumer electronics,\nthen our costs would lower.\" I'm like, \"Okay, so let's say\" we skip, \"now you're making a million units a year. Is it still expensive?\" If the answer is yes, then economies of scale are not the issue. - Do you throw, into manufacturing, do you throw like supply chain, you talked about resources and materials and stuff like that, do you throw that into the\ncalculation of trying to reason from first principles? Like, how are we gonna make\nthe supply chain work here? - Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] And then the cost of\nmaterials, things like that, or is that too much?\n- Yeah. Exactly. Like a good example of thinking\nabout things in the limit is if you take any product, any machine or whatever, like take a rocket or whatever,\nand say, if you've got, if you look at the raw\nmaterials in the rocket, so you're gonna have like aluminum, steel, titanium, Inconel, specialty alloys, copper. And you say, \"What's the weight of\nthe constituent elements of each of these elements, and what is their raw material value?\" And that sets the asymptotic limit for how low the cost\nof the vehicle can be, unless you change the materials. And then when you do that, I call it like maybe the magic one number or something like that. So that would be like, if you had the, just a pile of these raw materials here, and you could wave a magic\nwand and rearrange the atoms into the final shape, that would be the lowest possible cost that you could make this thing for, unless you change the materials. So then, and that is always, almost always a very low number. So then, what's actually\ncausing things to be expensive is how you put the atoms\ninto the desired shape. - Yeah, actually, if you don't mind me\ntaking a tiny tangent, I had a, I often talk to Jim Keller who's somebody that worked with you as a- - Oh yeah. Jim did great work at Tesla. - So, I suppose he carries the flame of the same kind of thinking\nthat you're talking about now. I guess I see that same thing at Tesla and SpaceX folks who work there, they kind of learn this way of thinking and it kinda becomes obvious almost. But anyway, I had argument, not argument. He educated me about how cheap it might be to manufacture Tesla Bot. We just, we had an argument. How can you reduce the cost,\nof scale, of producing a robot? Because, so far I've gotten a chance to interact quite a bit,\nobviously in the academic circles, with humanoid robots, and then with Boston\nDynamics and stuff like that. And they're very expensive to build. And then Jim kinda\nschooled me on saying like, \"Okay, this kind of\nfirst principles thinking of how can we get the cost\nof manufacturing down.\" I suppose you do that, you\nhave done that kind of thinking for Tesla Bot and for all kinds of, all kinds of complex, systems\nthat are traditionally seen as complex, and you say, \"Okay, how can we\nsimplify everything down?\" - Yeah. I mean, I think if you are\nreally good at manufacturing, you can basically make, at high volume you can basically\nmake anything for a cost that asymptotically approaches\nthe raw material value of the constituents, plus\nany intellectual property that you need to license. Anything.\n- Right. - But it's hard. It's not like that's a\nvery hard thing to do, but it is possible for anything. Anything in volume can\nbe made of, like I said, for a cost that asymptotically approaches it's raw material constituents plus intellectual property license rights. So what will often happen in\ntrying to design a product is people will start with the\ntools and parts and methods that they are familiar with, and try to create a product using their existing tools and methods. The other way to think about\nit is actually imagine the, try to imagine the platonic\nideal of the perfect product or technology, whatever it might be, and say, \"What is this? What is the perfect arrangement of atoms that would be the best possible product? And now let us try to figure\nout how to get the atoms in that shape.\" - I mean, it sounds, it's almost like \"Rick and Morty\" absurd until you start to really think about it. And you really should\nthink about it in this way 'cause everything else\nis kind of, if you think you might fall victim to the momentum of the way things are done in the past, unless you think in this way. - Well, just as a function of inertia, people will want to use\nthe same tools and methods that they are familiar with. That's what they'll do by default. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then that will lead\nto an outcome of things that can be made with\nthose tools and methods, but is unlikely to be the platonic ideal of the perfect product. So that's why it's good to think of things in both directions, so like what can we build\nwith the tools that we have, but also what is the perfect, the theoretical perfect product look like? And that theoretical perfect product is gonna be a moving target, 'cause as you learn more the definition of that perfect product will change 'cause you don't actually know\nwhat the perfect product is, but you can successfully\napproximate a more perfect product. So, thinking about it like\nthat, and then saying, \"Okay, now what tools,\nmethods, materials, whatever, do we need to create in\norder to get the atoms in that shape? But people very rarely\nthink about it that way. But it's a powerful tool. - I should mention that the\nbrilliant Shivon Zilis is hanging out with us, in case you hear a voice of wisdom from outside, from up above. Okay. So let me ask you about Mars. You mentioned it would\nbe great for science to put a base on the\nmoon, to do some research, but the truly big leap, again, in this category\nof seemingly impossible, is to put a human being on Mars. When do you think SpaceX will\nland a human being on Mars? - Hm. Best case is about five years, worst case 10 years. - What are the determining\nfactors, would you say, from an engineering perspective? Or is that not the bottlenecks? - No, it's fundamentally\nyou're engineering the vehicle. I mean Starship is the most\ncomplex and advanced rocket that's ever been made by, I don't know, order of magnitude or something like that. It's a lot. It's really next level. And the fundamental\noptimization of Starship is minimizing cost per ton to orbit, and ultimately cost per\nton to the surface of Mars. This may seem like a mercantile objective, but it is actually the thing\nthat needs to be optimized. There is a certain cost per\nton to the surface of Mars where we can afford to establish\na self-sustaining city. And then above that, we\ncannot afford to do it. So, right now you can fly\nto Mars for $1 trillion. No amount of money could\nget you a ticket to Mars. So we need to get that above, to get that like something that\nis actually possible at all. We don't want to just wanna have, with Mars, flags and footprints, and then not come back for a half century like we did with the moon. In order to pass a very important, great filter. I think we need to be\na multi-planet species. This ways sound somewhat\nesoteric to a lot of people, but, eventually given enough time, something, Earth is likely\nto experience some calamity, that could be something that\nhumans do to themselves, or an external event like\nhappened to the dinosaurs. But if, eventually, if none of that happens,\nand somehow, magically, we keep going, then the sun will, the sun is gradually expanding\nand will engulf the earth. And probably Earth gets too hot for life in about 500 million years. It's a long time, but\nthat's only 10% longer than earth has been around. And so if you think about like\nthe, the current situation, it's really remarkable and\nkind of hard to believe, but Earth's been around four\nand a half billion years, and this is the first time in\nfour and a half billion years that it's been possible to\nextend life beyond Earth. And that window of opportunity\nmay be open for a long time, and I hope it is, but it also may be open for a short time, and we should, I think\nit is wise for us to act quickly while the window is open. Just in case it closes. - Yeah, the existence of\nnuclear weapons, pandemics, all kinds of threats, - [Elon] Yeah. - should kind of give us some motivation. - I mean, civilization could get, could die with a bang or a whimper. If it dies of demographic collapse, then it's more of a whimper, obviously. And if it's World War\nIII, it's more of a bang, but these are all risks. I mean, it's important to\nthink of these things and just, things like probabilities,\nnot certainties, there's a probability that\nsomething bad will happen on earth. I think most likely the\nfuture will be good, but there's, let's say\nfor argument's sake, a 1% chance per century of\na civilization ending event. Like that was Stephen Hawking's estimate. I think he might be right about that. We should basically think of this, being a multi-planet species, just like taking out\ninsurance for life itself, like life insurance for life. (both laughing) - This turned into a\ninfomercial real quick. - Life insurance for life, yes. And we can bring the creatures from, plants and animals from Earth to Mars, and breathe life into the planet, and have a second planet with life. That would be great. They can't bring themselves there, so if we don't bring them to Mars, then they will just for sure all die when the sun expands anyway,\nand then that'll be it. - What do you think is\nthe most difficult aspect of building civilization\non Mars, terraforming Mars, like from engineering perspective, from a financial perspective,\nhuman perspective, to get a large number of folks there who will never return back to Earth? - No, they could certainly return, some will return back to Earth. - They will choose to stay there for the rest of their lives. - Yeah, many will. We need the spaceships back,\nlike the ones that go to Mars, we need them back, so you\ncan hop on if you want. But we can't just not have\nthe spaceships come back, those things are expensive. We need them back. I'd like to come back\nand journal their trip. - I mean, do you think about\nthe terraforming aspect, actually building, are\nyou're so focused right now on the spaceships part that's so critical to get to Mars?\n- Yeah, yeah. We absolutely, if you can't get\nthere, nothing else matters. And like I said, we can't get there at some extraordinarily high cost. I mean, the current cost of let's say one ton to the surface of Mars is on the order of a billion dollars. So, 'cause you don't just\nneed the rocket and the launch and everything, you need like heat shield, you need guidance system, you need deep space communications. You need some kind of landing system. So, like rough approximation\nwould be a billion dollars per ton to the surface of Mars right now. This is obviously way too expensive to create a self-sustaining civilization. So we need to improve that by at least a factor of a thousand. - [Lex] A million per ton? - Yes, ideally less than,\nmuch less than a million ton. You have to say like, well how much can society afford to spend or want to spend on a\nself-sustaining city on Mars? The self-sustaining part is important. Like it's just the key threshold, the grateful to, we'll have been passed, when the city on Mars can survive even if the space ships\nfrom earth stop coming, for any reason. Doesn't matter what the reason is. But if they stop coming for any reason, will it die out or will it not? And if there's even one\ncritical ingredient missing, then it still doesn't count. It's like if you're in a long sea voyage and you've got everything\nexcept vitamin C. (Elon laughing) It's only a matter of\ntime, you're gonna die. So we gotta get a Mars city to the point where it's self sustaining. I'm not sure this will\nreally happen in my lifetime, but I hope to see it at\nleast have a lot of momentum. And then you could say, \"Okay, what is the\nminimum tonnage necessary to have a self-sustaining city?\" And there's a lot of\nuncertainty about this. You could say, I dunno, it's probably at least a million tons. 'Cause you have to set up a\nlot of infrastructure on Mars. Like I said, you can't be missing anything that in order to be self-sustaining, you can't be, like you\nneed a semiconductor, fabs, you need iron ore refineries, you need lots of things, you know? And Mars is not super hospitable. It's the least inhospitable planet, but it's definitely a\nfixer upper of a planet. - [Lex] Outside of Earth. - Yes. - Earth is pretty good.\n- Earth is like easy. Yeah. - And, also, we should\nclarify in the solar system. - [Elon] Yes. In the solar system. - There might be nice like vacation spots. - There might be some\ngreat planets out there, but it's hopeless- - Too hard to get there? - Yeah, way, way, way, way, way too hard, to say the least. - Let me push back on that. Not really a pushback, but quick\na curve ball of a question. So you did mention physics\nas the first starting point. General relativity allows for worm holes. They technically can exist. Do you think those can\never be leveraged by humans to travel fast in the speed of light? Or are you saying- - The worm hole thing is debatable. We currently do not know of any means of going faster than the speed of light. There are some ideas about having space. You're gonna move at the\nspeed of light through space, but if you can make space itself move, that would be warping space. Space is capable of moving\nfaster than the speed of light. - [Lex] Right. - Like the universe in the big bang, the universe expanded at much\nmore than the speed of light, by a lot. - [Lex] Yeah. If this is possible, the\namount of energy required to warp space is so gigantic,\nit boggles the mind. - So, all the work you've\ndone with propulsion, how much innovation is possible\nwith rocket propulsion? I mean, you've seen it all, and you're constantly\ninnovating in every aspect. How much is possible? Like how much, can you get 10 X somehow? Is there something in there, in physics, that you can get significant improvement in terms of efficiency of engines and all those kinds of things? - Well, as I was saying,\nreally the holy grail is a fully and rapidly\nreasonable orbital system. Right now, the Falcon 9 is the only\nreusable rocket out there. The booster comes back and lands, you've seen the videos. And we got the nose cone or fairing back, but we do not get the upper stage back. That means that we have a minimum cost of building an upper stage. You can think of like a two-stage rocket of sort of like two airplanes, like a big airplane and a small airplane, and we get the big airplane back, but not the smaller airplane. And so it still costs a lot. That upper stage is at least $10 million. And then the degree of the booster is not as rapidly and\ncompletely reusable as we'd like in order of the pharynx. So, our kind of minimum marginal\ncost not counting overhead for per flight is on the order of 15 to $20 million, maybe. That's extremely good\nfor, it's by far better than any rocket ever in history. But with full and rapid reusability, we can reduce the cost per ton to orbit by a factor of a hundred. Just think of it like, like imagining if you had an\naircraft or something or a car. And if you had to buy a\nnew car every time you went for a drive, that'll be very expensive. It'll silly, frankly.\n- Mhm. - But, in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car and\nthat's makes your trip, I don't know, a thousand times cheaper. So, it's the same for rockets. Very difficult to make\nthis complex machine that can go to orbit. And so if you cannot reuse it, and have to throw even any\nsignificant part of it away, that massively increases the cost. Starship in theory could\ndo a cost per launch of like a million, maybe $2\nmillion or something like that. And put over a hundred tons\nin orbit, which is crazy. - Yeah. That's incredible. So you're saying it's, by far\nthe biggest bang for the buck is to make it fully reusable versus like some kind of\nbrilliant breakthrough in theoretical physics. - No, no, there's no, there's no brilliant brea, no, there's no. We gotta make the rocket reusable, this is an extremely\ndifficult engineering problem. - Got it.\n- But no new physics is required. - Just brilliant engineering. Let me ask a slightly\nphilosophical fun question. Gotta ask. I know you're focused on getting to Mars, but once we're there on Mars, what form of government, economic\nsystem, political system, do you think would best for an\nearly civilization of humans? The interesting reason\nto talk about this stuff, it also helps people\ndream about the future. I know you're really focused about the short-term engineering dream, but it's like, I don't know. There's something about imagining an actual civilization on\nMars that gives people, - Sure.\n- really gives people hope. - Well, it would be a new\nfrontier and an opportunity to rethink the whole nature of government just as was done in the\ncreation of the United States. I mean, I would suggest having a direct democracy, like people vote directly on things, as opposed to representative democracy. So, representative democracy, I think, is too subject to a special interests and coercion of the politicians\nand that kind of thing. So I'd recommend that there's just direct democracy. People vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves, and then the laws must be short enough that people can understand them. - Yeah, and then keeping\na well-informed populace, really being transparent\nabout all the information about what they're voting for. - Yeah. Absolute transparency. - Yeah. And not make it as annoying as those cookies we have to accept- - Have to accept cookies. There's always a slight\namount of trepidation when you click accept cookies. I feel as though there's\nperhaps a very tiny chance that'll open a portal to\nhell or something like that. - [Lex] That's exactly how I feel. Why do they keep wanting\nme to accept that? What do they want with this cookie? Somebody got upset with accepting cookies or something somewhere. I mean, who cares? So annoying to keep\naccepting all these cookies. - [Lex] To me, it's just a great- - I'm tired of accept-\n(Shivon speaking faintly) Yes you can have my damn\ncookie, I don't care. Whatever. - [Lex] You heard it from me Elon first, he accepts all your damn cookies. - Yeah. (both laughing) And stop asking me. It's annoying. - Yeah, it's one example of implementation of a good idea done really horribly. - Yeah, somebody was like,\nthere's some good intentions of like privacy or whatever, but now everyone's just\nhas to tick accept cookies and it's now, you have\nbillions of people who have to keep clicking accept cookie\nand it's super annoying. Just accept the damn cookie, it's fine. There is like, I think\nfundamental problem that we're, because we've not really had a major, like a world war or something\nlike that in a while. And obviously we would like\nto not have world wars. There's not been a cleansing function for rules and regulations. So wars did have some silver lining in that there would be a reset on rules and regulations after a war. So World Wars I and II\nthere were huge resets on rules and regulations. If society does not have a war, and there's no cleansing\nfunction or garbage collection for rules and regulations, then rules and regulations\nwill accumulate every year 'cause they're immortal. There's no actual, humans die, but the laws don't. So, we need a garbage collection function for rules and regulations that\nshould not just be immortal. 'Cause some of the rules and regulations that are put in place\nwill be counterproductive, done with good intentions,\nbut counterproductive. And sometimes not done\nwith good intentions. If rules and regulations\njust accumulate every year, and you get more and more of them, then eventually you won't\nbe able to do anything. You're just like Gulliver with, tied down by thousands of little strings. And we see that in, U.S. and LA, basically all economies that have been around for awhile, and regulators and\nlegislators create new rules and regulations every year, but they don't put effort\ninto removing them. And I think that's very important that we put effort into\nremoving rules and regulations. But it gets tough 'cause\nyou get special interests that then are dependent on, they have a vested interest in\nthat whatever rule regulation and that they, then they\nfight to not get it removed. - Yeah. I mean, I guess the problem\nwith the constitution is it's kinda like C versus Java 'cause it doesn't have any\ngarbage collection built in. I think there should be. When you first said the\nmetaphor of garbage collection, I loved it\n- Yeah, it's from a coding standpoint. - From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah. It would be interesting if the laws themselves\nkinda had a built in thing where they kinda die after a while, unless somebody explicitly\npublicly defends them. So that's sort of, it's not\nlike somebody has to kill them. They kinda die themselves. They disappear. - [Elon] Yeah. - Not to defend Java or anything, C++, you could also have\ngreat garbage collection in Python and so on. - Yeah. So, yeah, something needs to happen or just the civilizations\narteries just harden over time. And you can just get less and less done because there's just a\nrule against everything. So I think, I don't know, for Mars, or whatever,\nI say, or even for here, obviously for Earth as well, I think there should be an active process for removing rules and regulations and questioning their existence. If we've got a function for\ncreating rules and regulations, 'cause rules and regulations\ncould also think of as like, they're like soft work or lines of code for operating a civilization, that's the rules and regulations. So it's not like we shouldn't\nhave rules and regulations, but you have your code\naccumulation, but no code removal. And so it just gets to be become\nbasically archaic bloatware after a while. And it's just, it makes it\nhard for things to progress. So, I don't know, maybe\nMars you'd have like any given law must have a sunset, and require active voting to keep it up there. I actually also say\nlike, and these are just, I don't know, recommendations or thoughts, and ultimately will be up to\nthe people on Mars to decide, but I think it should be easier to\nremove a law than to add one, because of the, just to\novercome the inertia of laws. So, maybe it's like, for argument's sake, you\nneed like say 60% vote to have a law take effect, but only a 40% vote to remove it. - So let me be the guy, you posted a meme on Twitter recently where there's like a row of urinals and a guy just walks all the way across - So true, yeah.\n- and he tells you about crypto. - Listen, I mean, that's\nhappened to me so many times, I think maybe even literally. (both laughing) - Do you think technologically\nspeaking there's any room for ideas of smart contracts or so on? 'Cause you mentioned laws, that's an interesting implement use of things like smart contracts to implement the laws by\nwhich governments function. Like something built on Ethereum, or maybe a dog coin that enables\nsmart contracts somehow. - I never, I didn't quite understand this whole smart contract thing. (both laughing) I'm too downtown to\nunderstand smart contracts. - That's a good line. (both laughing) - I mean, my general approach to any kind of deal or whatever is just make sure there's\nclarity of understanding. That's the most important thing. - [Lex] Right. - And just keep any kind of\ndeal very short and simple, plain language, and just make\nsure everyone understands this is the deal. Does everyone, is it clear? And what are the consequences\nif first things don't happen? But usually deals are, business deals or whatever\nare way too long and complex and overly lawyered and pointlessly. - You mentioned that Doge\nis the people's coin. - [Elon] Yeah. - And you said that you\nwere literally going, SpaceX may consider literally putting a Dogecoin on the moon. - Yeah.\n- Is this something you're still considering, Mars perhaps, do you think there's some chance, we've talked about\npolitical systems on Mars, that a Dogecoin is the\nofficial currency of Mars, it's the coin of the future? - Well, I think Mars itself will need to have a different currency because you can't synchronize\ndue to speed of light, or not easily. - So it must be complete\nstandalone from earth. - Well, yeah, Mars is, at closest approach, it's four light minutes away roughly, and then add for this approach, it's roughly 20 light minutes\naway, maybe a little more. So you can't really have\nsomething synchronizing if you've got a 20 minute\nspeed of light issue, if it's got a one minute blockchain. It's not gonna synchronize properly. I don't know if Mars would have\na cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably, seems likely. But it would be so kind of\nlocalized thing on Mars. - And you let the people decide. - Yeah, absolutely. The future of Mars should\nbe up to the martians. I mean, I think the cryptocurrency thing is an interesting approach to reducing the error in the database that is called money. I think I have a pretty deep understanding of what money actually is on\na practical day-to-day basis, because of PayPal. We really got in deep there. And right now the money system, actually for practical purposes is really a bunch of\nheterogeneous mainframes running a old COBOL. - [Lex] Okay, you mean literally- - Literally.\n- That is literally what's happening. - in batch mode. Okay. - In batch mode.\n- Yeah. Pity the poor bastards who have\nto've maintained that code. Okay. That's pain. - [Lex] Not even Fortrans, COBOL, yep. - That's COBOL. And they still, the banks\nare still buying mainframes, in 2021, and running engine COBOL code. The federal reserve is\nlike probably even older than what the banks have, and they have an old COBOL mainframe. And so the government effectively\nhas editing privileges on the money database. And they use those editing privileges to make more money whenever they want. And this increases the error\nin the database that is money. So I think money should really be viewed through the lens of information theory. You're kinda like an internet connection. Like what's the bandwidth, total bit rate, what is the latency jitter, packet drop, errors in the network communication. Just think of money like that basically. I think that's probably\nwhat I really think of it. And then say what system, from an information theory standpoint, allows an economy to function the best. Crypto is an attempt to reduce the error in money that is contributed by governments diluting the money supply as basically a pernicious\nform of taxation. - So both policy in\nterms of with inflation, and actual like technological, COBOL, cryptocurrency takes us\ninto the 21st century in terms of the actual\nsystems that allow you to do the transaction, to store wealth, all those kinds of things. - Like I said, just think\n- In theory. - of money as information,\npeople often will think of money as having power in and of itself. It does not. Money is information, and it does not have\npower in and of itself. Applying the physics tools\nof thinking about things in the limit is helpful. If you are stranded on a tropical island and you have a trillion\ndollars, it's useless. 'Cause there's no resource allocation. Money is a database of\nresource allocation, but there's no resources to\nallocate except yourself. So money's useless. If you're stranded on a\ndesert island with no food, all the Bitcoin in the world will not stop you from starving. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just think of money as a database for resource allocation\nacross time and space. And then what system, in what form should that\ndatabase, or data system, what would be most effective? There is a fundamental\nissue with, say Bitcoin, in its current form in that it's, the transaction\nvolume is very limited. And the latency, the latency, for a properly\nconfirmed transaction is too long, much longer than you'd like. It's actually not great from\ntransaction volume standpoint or latency standpoint. So it is perhaps useful as, to solve an aspect of the\nmoney database problem, which is the sort of store of wealth or an accounting of relative\nobligations, I suppose. But it is not useful as a currency, as a day-to-day currency. - But people have proposed different technological solutions- - [Elon] Like Lightning. - Yeah, Lightening Network\nand the Layer 2 technologies on top of that. I mean, it's all, it seems to\nbe all kind of a trade-off, but the point is, it's\nkinda brilliant to say, to just think about information, think about what kind of database, what kind of infrastructure enables the exchange of-\n- Yeah, let's say like you're operating an economy, and you need to have\nsome thing that allows for the efficient, to have\nefficient value ratios between products and services. So you've got this massive\nnumber of products and services, and need to, you can't just barter. 'Cause that would be extremely unwieldy. So you need something that gives you a ratio of exchange\nbetween goods and services. And then, something that\nallows you to shift obligations across time, like debt, debt and equity shift\nobligations across time. Then what does the best job of that? Part of the reason why\nI think there's some merit to Dogecoin, even though, it was\nobviously created as a joke, is that it actually does have a much higher transaction\nvolume capability than Bitcoin. The costs of doing a transaction, the Dogecoin fee is very low. Like right now, if you wanna\ndo a Bitcoin transaction, the price of doing that\ntransaction is very high, so you could not use it\neffectively for most things. And nor could it even\nscale to a high volume. And when Bitcoin was started, I guess around 2008 or\nsomething like that, the internet connections were much worse than they are today,\nlike order of magnitude. I mean, they were way, way worse in 2008. So like having a small block\nsize or whatever it is, and a long synchronization\ntime made sense in 2008, but, 2021, or fast forward 10 years, it's like, comically low. And I think there's some value\nto having a linear increase in the amount of currency\nthat is generated. So, because some amount of the currency, if a currency is too deflationary\nor like, or should say if, if a currency is expected to\nincrease in value over time, there's reluctance to spend it. 'Cause you're like, \"Oh, if I, I'll just hold it and not spend it because its scarcity is\nincreasing with time, so if I spend it now, then\nI will regret spending it. So I will just, you know, hoard all it.\" But if there's some dilution of the currency occurring over time, that's more of an incentive\nto use that as a currency. So Dogecoin just somewhat randomly has just a fixed a number of\nsort of coins or hash strings that are generated every year. So there's some inflation, but it's not a percentage at base. It's a fixed number, so the percentage of inflation will necessarily\ndecline over time. I'm not saying that it's\nlike the ideal system for a currency, but I think it actually is\njust fundamentally better than anything else I've\nseen, just by accident. - I like how you said\naround 2008, so you're not, some people suggest that you\nmight be Satoshi Nakamoto. You've probably said you're not. Let me ask-\n- I'm not. - You're not, for sure. Would you tell us if you were? - Yes.\n- Okay. Do you think it's a feature or a bug that he's anonymous, or she, or they? It's an interesting kind\nof quirk of human history that there is a particular technology that is a completely anonymous inventor. Or creator. - Well, I mean, you can look\nat the evolution of ideas before the launch of Bitcoin and see who wrote about those ideas. And then, I don't know, obviously I don't know who created Bitcoin for practical purposes, but the evolution of ideas\nis pretty clear for that. And, it seems as though Nick Szabo is probably more than\nanyone else responsible for the evolution of those ideas. So, here he claims not to be Nakamoto, but I'm not sure,\nthat's neither here nor there, but he seems to be the\none more responsible for the ideas behind\nBitcoin than anyone else. - So it's not, perhaps, like\nsingular figures aren't even as important as the figures\ninvolved in the evolution of ideas that led to things. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. Perhaps it's sad to think about history, but maybe most names\nwould be forgotten anyway. - What is a name anyway, it's a name, a name attached to an idea. What does it even mean really? - I think Shakespeare had a\nthing about roses and stuff, whatever he said. - \"Rose by any other name\nwould smell as sweet.\" (Lex laughing) - I got Elon to quote Shakespeare. I feel like I accomplished\nsomething today. - \"Shall I compare thee\nto a summer's day?\" (both laughing) - [Lex] I'm gonna clip that out instead. - Thou art more temporate and more fair. (both laughing)\n(Shivon speaking faintly) - Autopilot. Tesla autopilot- (Elon laughing) Tesla autopilot has been\nthrough an incredible journey over the past six years, or perhaps even longer in the minds of, in your mind, and the\nminds of many involved. - I think that's where we\nfirst like connected, really, was the autopilot stuff, autonomy and... - The whole journey was\nincredible to me to watch. 'Cause I knew, well, part\nof it is I was at MIT and I knew the difficulty\nof computer vision. And I knew the whole, I had a lotta colleagues and friends, about the DARPA challenge,\nand knew how difficult it is. And so there was a natural skepticism when I first drove a Tesla with the initial system based on Mobileye. I thought there's no way. So at first when I got in I thought \"There's no way this car could maintain, like stay in the lane and create\na comfortable experience.\" So my intuition initially was\nthat the lane-keeping problem is way too difficult to solve. - [Elon] Oh lane-keeping,\nyeah, that's relatively easy. - But solve in the way that we just, we talked about previous, this prototype, versus a thing that actually\ncreates a pleasant experience over hundreds of thousands\nof miles or millions. Yeah, so, I was proven wrong-\n- We had to wrap a lot of code\naround the Mobileye thing, it doesn't just work by itself. - I mean, that's part of the story of how you approach things sometimes. Sometimes you do things from scratch. Sometimes at first you kind\nof see what's out there, and then you decide to from scratch. That was one of the\nboldest decisions I've seen is both on the hardware and the software to decide to eventually go from scratch. I thought, again, I was skeptical of whether that's going\nto be able to work out 'cause it's such a difficult problem. And so it was an incredible journey, what I see now with everything,\nthe hardware, the compute, the sensors, the things I\nmaybe care and love about most is the stuff that Andrej\nKarpathy's leading with, the dataset selection, the\nwhole data engine process, the neural network architectures, the way that's in the real world, that network is tested, validated, all the different test sets, versus the image net\nmodel of computer vision, like what's in academia is like real world\nartificial intelligence. - Andrej's awesome and obviously\nplays an important role, but we have a lot of really\ntalented people driving things. Ashok is actually the head\nof autopilot engineering. Andrej's the director of AI. - Ai stuff, yeah. So yeah, I'm aware that\nthere's an incredible team of just a lot going on. - People will give me too much credit, and they'll give Andrej too much credit. - And people should realize\nhow much is going on under the- - Yeah, just a lot of\nreally talented people. The Tesla Autopilot AI\nteam is extremely talented. It's like some of the\nsmartest people in the world. So, yeah, and we're getting it done. - What are some insights you've gained over those five, six years of autopilot about the problem of autonomous driving. So, you leaped in having some sort of first principles\nkinds of intuitions, but nobody knows how difficult the pro- - Yeah, I thought the self-driving\nproblem would be hard, but it was harder than I thought. It's not like I thought it'd be easy, I thought it would be very hard, but it was actually way\nharder than even that. So, I mean want it comes\ndown to at the end of the day is to solve self-driving\nyou have to solve. You basically need to recreate what humans do to drive, which is humans drive\nwith optical senses, eyes, and biological neural nets. And so in order to, that's how the entire road\nsystem is designed to work, with basically passive\noptical and neural nets, biologically. So, for actually, for\nfull self driving to work, we have to recreate that in digital form. So we have to, that means cameras with advanced neural nets in silicon form. And then it will obviously\nsolve for small cell driving. That's the only way, I don't\nthink there's any other way. - But the question is what\naspects of human nature do you have to encode\ninto the machine, right? So you have to solve the\nperception problem, like detect, and then you first realize, what is the perception\nproblem for driving? Like all the kinds of things\nyou have to be able to see. Like what do we even\nlook at when we drive? There's, I just recently heard, Andrej talked about, at\nMIT, about like car doors. I think it was the world's\ngreatest talk of all time about car doors. The fine details of car doors, like what is even an open car door, man. So like the ontology of that, that's a perception problem. We humans solve that perception problem, and Tesla has to solve that problem. And then there's the\ncontrol and the planning, coupled with the perception. You have to figure out like\nwhat's involved in driving, especially in all the\ndifferent edge cases. Maybe you can comment on this, how much game theoretic kind\nof stuff needs to be involved, at a four-way stop sign? As humans, when we drive,\nour actions affect the world. - True.\n- It changes how others behave, most autonomous driving, you're usually just\nresponding to the scene, as opposed to like really\nasserting yourself in the scene. Do you think... - I think these sort of\ncontrol logic conundrums are not the hard part. Let's see... - [Lex] What do you think is the hard part in this whole beautiful complex problem? - It's a lot of freaking software man, and a lot of smart lines of code. For sure, in order to create an accurate vector space. You're coming from image space, which is like this flow of photons going to the camera, cameras and then since you have\nthis massive bitstream in image space, and then you have to\neffectively compress the, a massive bitstream corresponding to photons\nthat knocked off an electron in a camera sensor and turn that bitstream into a vector space. By vector space I mean, you've got cars and humans and lane lines and curves and traffic lights and that kind of thing. Once you have an accurate vector space, the control problem is similar\nto that of a video game, like a \"Grand Theft Auto\" or \"Cyberpunk.\" If you have accurate vector space. It's, the control problem is, I wouldn't say it's trivial,\nit's not trivial, but it's it's not like some insurmountable thing. Having an accurate vector\nspace is very difficult. - Yeah, I think we humans\ndon't give enough respect to how incredible the\nhuman perception system is to mapping the raw photons to the vector space\nrepresentation in our heads. - Your brain is doing an\nincredible amount of processing and giving you an image that\nis a very cleaned up image. Like when we look around here, you see color in the corners of your eyes, but actually your eyes\nhave very few cones, cone receptors in the peripheral vision. Your eyes are painting color\nin the peripheral vision. You don't realize it, but they're, eyes are\nactually painting color and your eyes will also\nhave, there's blood vessels and all sorts of gnarly things, and there's a blind spot, but\ndo you see your blind spot? No, your brain is painting in\nthe missing, the blind spot. You're gonna do these things online where you look here and look at this point and then look at this point, and it's, if it's in your blind spot, your brain will just fill in the missing bits.\n- So cool. The peripheral vision's so cool. - Yeah.\n- It makes you realize all the illusions, provision science, it makes you realize just\nhow incredible the brain is. - The brain's doing a crazy\namount of post-processing on the vision signals from your eyes. It's insane. And then even once you get\nall those vision signals, your brain is constantly trying to forget as much as possible. So human memory is perhaps the\nweakest thing about the brain is memory. So because memory is so\nexpensive to our brain, and so limited, your brain is trying to\nforget as much as possible and distill the things that you see into the smallest amounts\nof information possible. So your brain is trying to not\njust get to a vector space, but get to a vector space that is the smallest possible vector space of only relevant objects. You can sort of look inside your brain, or at least I can like when\nyou drive down the road, and try to think about what\nyour brain is actually doing, - Yeah\n- consciously. It's like, you'll see a car,\nbecause you don't have cameras. You don't have eyes in the\nback of your head or the side, so you say like, you're\nbasically, your head is like a, you basically have like two\ncameras on a slow gimbal. (both laughing) And eyesight's not that great. Okay? Human eyes are... And people are constantly distracted and thinking about things and texting and doing all sorts of things\nthey shouldn't do in a car, changing the radio station. So, having arguments. When's the last time you\nlooked right and left, and rearward, or even diagonally forward to actually refresh your vector space? So you're glancing around\nand what your mind is doing is trying to distill the relevant vectors, basically objects with\na position and motion, and then editing that\ndown to the least amount that's necessary for you to drive. - It does seem to be able to edit it down or compress even further\ninto things like concept, so it's not, it's like it goes\nbeyond, the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space to sort of space of concepts, to where you'll see a thing, it's no longer represented\nspatially somehow, it's almost like a concept\nthat you should be aware of. If this is a school zone, you'll remember that as a concept. Which is a weird thing to represent, but perhaps for driving you don't need to fully represent those things. Or maybe you get those kind of - Well you-\n- indirectly. - You need to established vector space and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces. Like you drive past say a bus and you see that there's people, before you drove past the\nbus you saw people crossing, or just imagine there's like a large truck or something blocking site. But before you came up\nto the truck you saw that there were some kids\nabout to cross the road in front of the truck. Now you can no longer see the kids, but you would now know, okay, those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck and cross the road. Even though you cannot see them. So you have to have memory. You need to remember that there\nwere kids there and you need to have some forward prediction of what their position will be. - It's a really hard problem\n- at the time of relevance. - So with occlusions and computer vision, when you can't see an object anymore, even when it just walks\nbehind a tree and reappears, that's a really, really, I mean, at least in academic literature, it's tracking through\nocclusions, it's very difficult. - Yeah, we're doin' it. - [Lex] I understand this. So some of it- - It's like object permanence. The same thing happens with\nthe humans with neural nets. When like a toddler grows up, there's a point in time\nwhere they develop, they have a sense of object permanence. So before a certain age, if you have a ball, or a toy or whatever, and you put it behind your\nback and you pop it out, before they have object permanence, it's like a new thing every time. It's like, \"Whoa, this toy\nwent poof, disappeared, and now it's back again.\"\nand they can't believe it. And that they can play\npeek-a-boo all day long because peek-a-boo's fresh every time. But then we figure out object\npermanence, then they realize, \"Oh, no, the object is not gone. It's just behind your back.\" - Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence.\n- Object permanence. Yeah, so that's a... - [Lex] That's an\nimportant problem to solve. - Yes. So, an important evolution of\nthe neural nets in the car is memory across both time and space. Now you can't remember, you\nhave to say how long do you want to remember things for. There's a cost to remembering\nthings for a long time. So you could run out of memory\nto try to remember too much for too long. And then you also have\nthings that are stale if you remember 'em for too long. And then you also need things\nthat are remembered over time. So even if you, say have, for evidence sake, five seconds\nof memory on a time basis, but, let's say you\nyou're parked at a light and you saw, use a pedestrian example,\nthat people were waiting to cross the cross the road, and you can't quite see them\nbecause of an occlusion, but they might wait for a\nminute before the light changes for them to cross the road. You still need to remember\nthat that's where they were, and that they're probably going\nto cross road type of thing. So even if that exceeds\nyour time-based memory, it should not exceed your space of memory. - And I just think the\ndata engine side of that, so getting the data to\nlearn all of the concepts that you're saying now,\nis an incredible process. It's this iterative process of just, there's this HydraNet of many- - HydraNet. We're changing the name to something else. - Okay. Alright. I'm sure it will be equally\nas \"Rick and Morty,\" like. - Yeah. We've re-architected the\nneural nets in the cars so many times, it's crazy. - Oh, so every time there's\na new major version, you'll rename it to\nsomething more ridiculous or, or memorable and beautiful, sorry. Not ridiculous of course. - If you see the full\nlike array of neural nets that are operating the cars,\nit kinda boggles the mind. There's so many layers. It's crazy. We started off with simple neural nets that were basically image recognition on a single\nframe from a single camera, and then trying to knit\nthose together with, with C. I should say, we were really\nfamiliar running C here, 'cause C++ is too much overhead, and we have our own C compiler. So, to get maximum\nperformance we actually wrote our own C compiler and are continuing to optimize our C compiler\nfor maximum efficiency. In fact, we've just\nrecently done a new rev on the C compiler that\nwill compile directly to our autopilot hardware. - So you wanna compile\nthe whole thing down with your own compiler? - Yeah.\n- So efficiency here, 'cause there's all kinds\nof computers, CPU, GPU, there's like basic types of things and you have to somehow\nfigure out the scheduling across all of those things. And so you're compiling the code down - Yeah.\n- that does all, okay. So that's why there's a\nlotta people involved. - There's a lot of hardcore\nsoftware engineering at a very sort of bare metal level. 'Cause we're trying to do a lot of compute that's constrained to the our full self-driving computer. And we wanna try to have the highest frames per second possible in a sort of very finite\namount of compute and power. We really put a lot of\neffort into the efficiency of our compute. So there's actually a lot of work done by some very talented software\nengineers at Tesla that, at a very foundational level\nto improve the efficiency of compute and how we use\nthe trip accelerators, which are basically doing matrix math, dot products, like a bazillion dot products. And it's like, one of\nour neural nets is like, compute wise, like 99% dot products. - And you wanna achieve\nas many high frame rates, like a video game, you want - Yeah.\n- full resolution, higher frame. - High frame rate, low latency, low jitter. I think one of the things\nwe're moving towards now is no post-processing of the image through the image signal processor. What happens for cameras is that, well almost all cameras, is they there's a lot of post-processing done in order to make pictures look pretty. And so we don't care about\npictures looking pretty. We just want the data. So we're moving just raw photon counts. The image that the computer sees is actually much more than what you'd see if you represent it on a camera, it's got much more data. And even in very low light conditions, you can see that there's a\nsmall photon count difference between this spot here\nand that spot there, which means that, so it can see\nin the dark incredibly well, because it can detect\nthese tiny differences in photon counts. Like much better than you\ncould possibly imagine. We also save 13 milliseconds on latency. - [Lex] From removing the\npost-processing on the image? - Yes.\n- Yeah. - 'Cause we've got eight\ncameras and then there's roughly, I don't know, one\nand a half milliseconds or so, maybe 1.6 milliseconds of\nlatency for each camera. Basically bypassing the image processor gets us back 13 milliseconds\nof latency, which is important. And we track latency all the way from photon hits the camera, to all the steps that it's\ngotta go through to get, go through the various\nneural nets and the C code, and there's a little bit\nof C++ there as well. Well, I can, maybe a lot, but it, the core stuff is, the\nheavy-duty compute is all in C. And so we track that latency all the way to an outward command to the drive unit to accelerate the brakes, to slow down the steering,\nturn left or right. 'Cause you gotta output a command, that's gotta go to a controller, and like some of these controllers have an update frequency that's maybe 10 Hertz or something like that, which is slow. That's like now you lose a\nhundred milliseconds potentially. So then we wanna update the drivers on the steering\nand braking control to have more like 100\nHertz instead of 10 Hertz, then you've got a 10 millisecond latency instead of 100 milliseconds\nworst-case latency. And actually, jitter is more\nof a challenge than latency, 'cause latency is, you can\nanticipate and predict, but if you've got a stackup of\nthings going from the camera to the computer, through then\na series of other computers, and finally to an actuator on the car; if you have a stackup of tolerances, of timing tolerances, then you can have quite\na variable latency, which is called jitter. And that makes it hard to anticipate exactly how\nyou should turn the car or accelerate because, if you've got maybe 150,\n200 milliseconds of jitter, then you could be off by 2.2 seconds. And this could make a big difference. - So you have to\ninterpolate somehow to deal with the effects of jitter, so they can make robust control decisions. So the jitters and the sensor information, or the jitter can occur at\nany stage in the pipeline. - If you have just, if\nyou have fixed latency, you can anticipate and like say, \"Okay, we know\nwhat that our information is,\" for argument's sake,\n\"150 milliseconds stale.\" For argument's sake, 150 milliseconds from photons taking camera to where you can measure a\nchange in the acceleration of the vehicle. Then you can just say, \"Okay, well we're gonna, we\nknow it's 150 milliseconds, so we're gonna take that into account and compensate for that latency.\" However, if you've got then\n150 milliseconds of latency, plus 100 milliseconds of jitter, which could be anywhere from zero to 100 milliseconds on top. So then your latency could be\nfrom 150, 250 milliseconds, now you've got 100 milliseconds that you don't know what to do with. That's basically random. So, getting rid of jitter\nis extremely important. - And that affects your control decisions and all of those kinds of things. Okay. - Yeah, the cars just gonna\nfundamentally maneuver better with lower jitter. - [Lex] Got it. - The cars will maneuver\nwith super human ability and reaction time, much\nfaster than a human. I mean, I think over time, the autopilot, full\nself-driving will be capable of maneuvers that are far more than what\nlike James Bond could do in like the best movie, type of thing. - That's exactly what I\nwas imagining in my mind, as you said it. - It's like impossible maneuvers\nthat a human couldn't do. - Well, let me ask sort of a,\nlooking back the six years, looking out into the future, based on your current understanding, how hard do you think this\nfull self-driving problem, when do you think Tesla\nwill solve level four FSD? - I mean, it's looking quite likely that it'll be next year. - And what does the solution look like? Is it the current pool\nof FSD beta candidates? They start getting greater and greater as they have been, degrees of autonomy. And then there's a certain level beyond which they can do their\nown, they can read a book. - Yeah. I mean, you can see,\nanybody who's been following the full self-driving beta closely will see that the rate of disengagements\nhas been dropping rapidly. So, like there's engagement\nB where the driver intervenes to prevent the car from doing something - [Lex] Right. dangerous potentially. So the interventions per million miles has been\ndropping dramatically. And that trend looks\nlike it happens next year is that the probability of an accident on FSD is less than that of the average human, and then significantly less\nthan that of the average human. So, it certainly appears like\nwe will get there next year. Then there's gonna be a case of, okay, well, we not have to\nprove this to regulators and prove it to, and we want a standard\nthat is not just equivalent to a human, but much better\nthan the average human. I think it's gotta be at least two or three times\nhigher safety than a human. Two or three times lower\nprobability of injury than a human before we would actually say like, \"Okay, it's okay to go.\" It's not gonna be equivalent, it's gonna be much better. - So if you look, FSD 10.6\njust came out recently, 10.7's on the way, maybe 11 is on the way\nsomewhere in the future. - Yeah. We were hoping to get 11\nout this year, but it's, 11 actually has a whole\nbunch of fundamental rewrites on the neural net architecture and some fundamental improvements\nin creating vector space. - So there is some fundamental leap that really deserves the 11. I mean, that's a pretty cool number. - Yeah. 11 would be a single stack for all, one stack to rule them all.\n- A single stack. But there are just some really fundamental neural net architecture changes that will allow for much more capability. At first they're gonna have issues. Like we have this working on\nlike sort of alpha software and it's good, but it's, it's basically taking a\nwhole bunch of C, C++ code and leading a massive amount of C++ code and replacing it with the neural net. And Andrej makes this point a lot, which is like neural nets\nare kind of eating software. Over time there's less and\nless conventional software, more and more neural net. Which is still software, but it's, still comes out to lines of software. But, just more neural net stuff, and less, heuristics basically. More matrix based stuff, and less heuristics based stuff. One of the big changes will be, right now the neural nets will deliver a giant bag of points to the C++, or C and C++ code. - [Lex] Yeah. - We call it the giant bag of points. - [Lex] Yeah. And it's like, so you got a pixel and something associated with that pixel, like this pixel is probably car, this pixel is probably landline. Then you've got to assemble\nthis giant bag of points in the C code and turn it into vectors. And it does a pretty\ngood job of it, but it's, we wanna just, we need another layer of neural nets on top of that to take the giant bag of points and distill that down to a vector space in the neural net part of the software, as opposed to the heuristics\npart of the software. This is a big improvement. - [Lex] Neural net's all\nthe way down, so you want. - It's not even all neural nets, but it's, this is a game changer to\nnot have the bag of points, the giant bag of points, that has to be assembled\nwith many lines of C, C++, and have a neural net just\nassemble those into a vector. So the neural net is outputting much, much less data, it's outputting, this is a lane line, this is a curb, this is drivable space, this is a car, this is a pedestrian or\ncyclist or something like that. It's outputting, it's really outputting proper vectors to the C, C++ control code, as opposed to, sort of, constructing the vectors in C. Which we've done, I think,\nquite a good job of, but it grew kinda hitting\na local maximum on the, how well the C can do this. So this is really a big deal. And just all of the networks\nin the car need to move to Surround Video, there's\nstill some Legacy Networks that are not Surround Video. And all of the training needs\nto move to Surround Video, and the efficiency of the\ntraining, it needs to get better, and it is. And then we need to move everything to raw photon counts, as opposed to processed images. - [Lex] Okay. So if you- - Which is quite a big\nreset on the training, 'cause the system's trained\non post-process imaged images. So we need to redo all the training to train against the raw photon counts, instead of the post-processed image. - So ultimately, it's kind\nof reducing the complexity of the whole thing. So, reducing.\n- Yep. Lines of code will actually go lower. - Yeah, that's fascinating. So you do infusion of all the sensors, so reducing the complexity\nof having to deal with these- - [Elon] Infusion of the cameras. - Sorry.\n- It's all cameras really. - Right, yes. Same with humans. - Yeah.\n- Well, I guess we got ears too, okay. - Yeah, we'll actually need\nto incorporate sound as well. 'Cause you know, you need to listen for ambulance sirens or firetrucks. If somebody, yelling at you\nor something, I don't know. It just, there's a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well. - Do you need to go to bathroom break? - [Elon] Yeah, sure, let's take a break. - Okay. - [Elon] Honestly, frankly, the ideas are the easy thing, and the implementation is the hard thing. The idea of going to the\nmoon is the easy part, but going to the moon is the hard part. - [Lex] Is the hard part. - And there's a lot of\nlike hardcore engineering that's gotta get done at the\nhardware and software level. Like I said, optimizing\nthe C compiler and just, cutting out latency everywhere. If we don't do this, the\nsystem will not work properly. So, the work of the engineers doing this, they are like the unsung heroes. But they are critical to the\nsuccess of the situation. - I think you made it clear. I mean, at least to me,\nit's super exciting, everything that's going on\noutside of what Andrej is doing. Just the whole infrastructure\nof the software. I mean, everything is\ngoing on with data engine, whatever it's called, the whole process is just a work of art. - The sheer scale of it\nis, it boggles the mind. The training, the amount\nof work done with, we've written all this custom software for training and labeling, and to do order labeling. Order labeling is essential. 'Cause, especially when you've\ngot like Surround Video, it's very difficult to label\nSurround Video from scratch is extremely difficult. Take humans such a long time to even label one video clip, like several hours. Or the order labeler, it basically will just apply heavy duty, a lot of compute to the video clips, to pre-assign and guess\nwhat all the things are that are going on in the Surround Video. - [Lex] And there's like correcting it. - Yeah, and then all the\nhuman has to do is like tweak, like say, adjust what is incorrect. This is like, increases productivity by 100 or more. - Yeah. So you've presented Tesla Bot as primarily useful in the factory. First of all, I think\nhumanoid robots are incredible from a fan of robotics. I think the elegance of\nmovement that humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show are just so cool. It's really interesting\nthat you're working on this and also talking about\napplying the same kind of, all the ideas, of some of\nwhich you've talked about, with data engine, all the\nthings that we're talking about, with Tesla autopilot, just\ntransferring that over to the, just yet another robotics problem. I have to ask since I care\nabout human robot interactions, so the human side of that. So you've talked about\nmostly in the factory. Do you see as part of this problem that Tesla Bot has to solve\nis interacting with humans and potentially having a\nplace like in the home. So, interacting, not just,\n- Sure. - not replacing labor, but also like, I don't know, being a\nfriend or an assistant. - [Elon] I think the\npossibilities are endless. Yeah, I mean, it's obviously, it's not quite in Tesla's\nprimary mission direction of accelerating sustainable energy, but it is an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world, which is to make a useful humanoid robot that is capable of\ninteracting with the world and helping in many different ways. So in factories, and really just, I mean, I think, if you say, extrapolate to many years in the future, I think work will become optional. There's a lot of jobs that, if people weren't paid to\ndo it, they wouldn't do it. Like it's not, it's not fun, necessarily. If you're washing dishes\nall day, it's like, eh. Even if you really like washing dishes, do you really wanna do it for\neight hours a day every day? Probably not. And then there's like dangerous work, and basically if it's dangerous, boring, has like potential for\nrepetitive stress injury, that kind of thing, then that's really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially. So that's what we're aiming for is to, for the humanoid robots to do jobs that people don't voluntarily want to do. And then we'll have to\npair that, obviously, with some kind of universal,\nbasic income in the future. So, I think. - Do you see a world when\nthere's like hundreds of millions of Tesla Bots doing different,\nperforming different tasks throughout the world? - Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far into the future, but I guess that there may\nbe something like that. - Can I ask a wild question? So, the number of Tesla\ncars has been accelerated and has been close to 2 million produced. Many of them have autopilot. - [Elon] I think we're over 2 million now. - Yeah. Do you think there'll ever be a time when there'll be more\nTesla Bots than Tesla cars? - Yeah. Actually, it's funny you ask this question 'cause normally I do\ntry to think pretty far into the future, but I\nhaven't really thought that far into the future with the Tesla Bot, or\nit's codenamed Optimus, I call it Optimus Subprime, because it's not like a\ngiant transformer robot. But it's meant to be a\ngeneral purpose help robot. And basically, the things\nthat were, basically, Tesla, I think, has the most\nadvanced real-world AI for interacting with the real world, which we've developed as a function to make self-driving work. And so, along with custom\nhardware and, like a lotta hardcore low-level software\nto have it run efficiently and be power efficient 'cause, it's one thing to do neural nets if you've got a gigantic server\nroom with 10,000 computers, but now, let's say you just, you have to now distill\nthat down into one computer that's running at low power\nin a humanoid robot or a car. That's actually very difficult and a lotta hardcore soft\nwork is required for that. So since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world with neural nets problem for cars, which are kinda like\nrobots with four wheels, then it's like kind of a\nnatural extension of that is to put it in a robot\nwith arms and legs. And actuators. The two hard things are, you basically need to make the, have the robot be intelligent\nenough to interact in a sensible way with the environment. So you need real real world AI, and you need to be very\ngood at manufacturing, which is a very hard problem. Tesla's very good at manufacturing, and also has the real world AI, so making the humanoid robot work is, basically it means developing custom motors and sensors that are different from\nwhat a car would use. I think we have the best expertise in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics. So, it just has to be for\nhumanoid robot application, not a car. - Still, you do talk about love sometimes. So let me ask, this isn't like for like sex robots or something- - [Elon] Love is the answer. - Yes. There is something compelling\nto us, not compelling, but we connect with humanoid\nrobots, or even legged robot, like with a dog, in shapes of dogs. It just, it seems like there's\na huge amount of loneliness in this world. All of us seek companionship\nwith other humans, friendship and all those kinds of things. We have a lot of here in Austin,\na lot of people have dogs. - [Elon] That's right. - There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease the amount of loneliness in the world, or help us humans\nconnects with each other. So, in a way that dogs can. Do you think about that\nwith Tesla Bot at all, or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks? Not connecting with humans? - I mean, to be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companionship standpoint, but I think it actually\nwould end up being, it could be actually\na very good companion. And it could develop a personality over time that is unique. It's not just all the robots are the same. And that personality could evolve to be, match the owner or the, I guess the owner. Whatever you wanna call it. The companion, the human.\n- The other half, right? In the same way that friends do. See, I think that's a huge opportunity. I think- - Yeah, no, that's interesting. 'Cause there's a Japanese phrase; wabi-sabi, the subtle imperfections are\nwhat makes something special. And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot, mapped to the subtle imperfections of the robot's human friend, dunno, owner sounds\nlike maybe the wrong word, but, could actually make an\nincredible buddy basically. - [Lex] And in that way, the imperfections-\n- Like R2-D2 or a C-3PO sort of thing. - So from a machine learning perspective, I think the flaws being\na feature is really nice. You could be quite\nterrible at being a robot for quite a while in the\ngeneral home environment or all in the general world. And that's kind of adorable and that's, those are your flaws, and you\nfall in love with those flaws. It's very different\nthan autonomous driving where it's a very high stakes environment, you cannot mess up. And so it's, yeah, it's more\nfun to be a robot in the home. - Yeah, in fact, if you think\nof like a C-3PO and R2-D2, they actually had a lot of\nlike flaws and imperfections and silly things and they\nwould argue with each other. - Were they actually\ngood at doing anything? I'm not exactly sure. - They definitely added\na lot to the story. But there sort of quirky elements and, that they would make\nmistakes and do things, it would just, it made them\nrelatable, I don't know. Endearing. So yeah, I think that that\ncould be something that, it probably would happen. But our initial focus is\njust to make it useful. I'm confident we'll get it done, I'm not sure what the exact timeframe is, but we'll probably have, I don't know, a decent prototype towards\nthe end of next year or something like that. - And it's cool that it's\nconnected to Tesla, the car. - Yeah, it's using a lotta, it would use the autopilot\ninference computer and a lot of the training that\nwe've done for the four cars, in terms of recognizing real world things, could be applied directly to the robot. But there's a lot of custom\nactuators and sensors that need to be developed. - And an extra module on top\nof the vector space for love. - Ah, yeah.\n- That's missing. Okay.\n- We could add that to the car too. - That's true. Yeah, it could be useful\nin all environments. Like you said, a lot of\npeople argue in the car, so maybe we can help 'em out. You're a student of history, fan of \"Dan Carlin's\nHardcore History\" podcast. - [Elon] Yeah. That's great. - Greatest podcast ever. - Yeah, I think it is, actually. - It almost doesn't\nreally count as a podcast. - [Elon] It's more like a audio book. - Yeah. So you were on the podcast with Dan, I just had a chat with him about it. He said you guys went military\nand all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, it was basically, it should be titled engineer wars. Essentially, when there's a rapid change in the rate of technology, then engineering plays a pivotal\nrole in victory in battle. - How far back in history did you go? Did you go to World War II? - Well, it was supposed to be a deep dive on fighters and bomber\ntechnology in World War II, but that ended up being\nmore wide-ranging than that. 'Cause I just went down the, a total rat hole of like\nstudying all of the fighters and bombers in World War II, and the constant rock,\npaper, scissors game that one country would make this plane, and they'd make a plane to beat that, and they'd try to make\na plane to beat that, and then they'll... And really what matters is\nlike the pace of innovation, and also access to high\nquality fuel and raw materials. So, like Germany had like\nsome amazing designs, but they couldn't make them because they couldn't\nget the raw materials. And they had a real\nproblem with the oil and fuel, basically, the fuel\nquality was extremely variable. - So the design wasn't\nthe bottleneck, it was- - Yeah, the U.S. had kick-ass fuel, that was very consistent, the problem is, if you make a very high\nperformance aircraft engine, in order to make it high performance, you have to the fuel, the aviation gas,\nhas to be a consistent mixture. And it has to have a high octane. High octane is the most important thing, but also can't have like\nimpurities and stuff 'cause you'll foul up the engine. And the German just never\nhad good access to oil. They try to get it by\ninvading the caucuses, but that didn't work too well. - That never works well.\n- Didn't work out for them. (woman speaking faintly) Nice to meet you. Germany was always struggling\nwith basically shitty oil, and so then they could\nnot, they couldn't count on high quality fuel for their aircraft. So then they had to have all\nthese additives and stuff. Whereas the U.S. had awesome fuel, and they provided that to Britain as well. So, that allowed the\nBritish and the Americans to design aircraft engines that\nwere super high-performance, better than anything else in the world. Germany could design the engines, they just didn't have the fuel. And then also the likes of the, the quality of the aluminum alloys that they were getting\nwas also not that great, and so, yeah. - [Lex] You talked\nabout all this with Dan? - Yep.\n- Awesome. Broadly looking at history,\nwhen you look at Genghis Khan, when you look at Stalin, Hitler, the darkest moments of human history, what do you take away from those moments? Does it help you gain\ninsight about human nature, about human behavior today? Whether it's the wars or the individuals, or just the behavior of\npeople, any aspects of history. - Yeah. I find history fascinating. There's just a lot of incredible\nthings that have been done, good and bad, that they just help you understand\nthe nature of civilization, and individuals, and... - Does it make you sad that humans do these kinds\nof things to each other? You look at the 20th\ncentury, World War II, the cruelty of the abuse of power. Talk about communism, Marxism, and Stalin. - I mean, some of these\nthings do, I mean, if you, there's a lot of human history, but most of it is actually people just getting on with their lives, and it's not like human history is just non-stop war and disaster, those are actually just, those\nare intermittent and rare, and if they weren't then humans\nwould soon cease to exist. But there's just that, wars\ntend to be written about a lot. Whereas something being like, well, a normal year where nothing major happened doesn't get written\nabout much, but that's, most people just like farming\nand kinda living their life. Being a villager somewhere. And every now and again, there's a war. I would have to say, there\naren't very many books that I, where I just had to stop reading, 'cause it was just too dark. But the book about \"Stalin\nThe Court Of The Red Star,\" I had stopped reading,\nit was just too dark. Rough. - Yeah. The 30s. There's a lot of lessons there to me, in particular that it feels like humans, all of us have that\nzeal, Solzhenitsyn line, that the line between good and evil runs to the heart in every man that all of us are capable of evil, all of us are capable of good, it's almost like this\nkind of responsibility that all of us have to tend towards the good. And so, to me, looking at history is\nalmost like an example of, look, you have some charismatic\nleader that convinces you of things, is too easy, based on that story to do evil, onto each other, onto\nyour family onto others. And so it's like our\nresponsibility to do good. It's not like now somehow\ndifferent from history, that can happen again, all\nof it can happen again. And yes, most of the time you're right. I mean, the optimistic view here is mostly people are just living life. And as you've often memed about, the quality of life was\nway worse back in the day, and it keeps improving over time, through innovation, through technology, but still it's somehow notable that these blimps of atrocities happen. - Sure. Yeah, I mean, life was really tough for most of history. I mean, probably for\nmost of human history, a good year would be one\nwhere not that many people in your village died of\nthe plague, starvation, freezing to death, or being\nkilled by a neighboring village. It's like, \"Well, it wasn't that bad.\" It was only like, \"You\nknow, we lost 5% this year. It was a good year.\"\n- Yeah. - That would be par for the course. Just not starving to death\nwould have been the primary goal of most people throughout history. Just making sure we'll have enough food to last through the winter and\nnot get, freeze or whatever. Now food is plentiful. We have an obesity problem. - Well, yeah, the lesson there is to be grateful for the way things are now for some of us. We've spoken about this offline. I'd love to get your\nthought about it here. If I sat down for a long\nform in person conversation with the President of\nRussia, Vladimir Putin, would you potentially want\nto call in for a few minutes to join in on a conversation with him, moderated and translated by me? - Sure. Yeah. Sure, I'd be happy to do that. - You've shown interest\nin the Russian language. Is this grounded in your interest in history of linguistics\nculture, general curiosity? - [Elon] I think it sounds cool. - Sounds cool, not looks cool. It takes a moment to read Cyrillic. Once you know what the\nCyrillic characters stand for, actually, then reading\nRussian becomes a lot easier 'cause there are a lot of words\nthat are actually the same. Like bank is bank. - So find the words that\nare exactly the same and now you start to\nunderstand Cyrillic, yeah. - If you can sound it out, then it's much, there's at least some\ncommonality of words. - What about the culture? You love great engineering, physics. There's a tradition of the sciences there. When you look at the 20th\ncentury, from rocketry. So, some of the greatest rockets, some of the space\nexploration has been done in the Soviet, in the former Soviet Union. - Yeah.\n- So, do you draw inspiration from that history? Just how this culture,\nthat in many ways, I mean, one of the sad things is,\nbecause of the language, a lot of it is lost to history, because it's not translated,\nall those kinds of, because it is in some\nways an isolated culture, it flourishes within it's borders. - [Elon] Yeah. - So do you draw inspiration\nfrom those folks, from the history of science engineering there?\n- Yeah. I mean, the Soviet Union,\nRussia, and Ukraine as well, have a really strong\nhistory in space flight, like some of the most\nadvanced and impressive things in history were done by the Soviet Union. One cannot help but admire the\nimpressive rocket technology that was developed. After the sort of fall\nof the Soviet Union, there's much less that happened, still things are happening,\nbut it's not quite at the frenetic pace that it was happening before the Soviet Union kind of dissolved into separate republics. - Yeah. I mean, there's the Roscosmos, the Russian, the agency. I look forward to a time\nwhen those countries, with China, are working\ntogether, the United States, they're all working together, maybe a little bit of\nfriendly competition, but. - I feel like friendly\ncompetition is good. Governments are slow and\nthe only thing slower than one government is a\ncollection of governments. (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - The Olympics would be boring if everyone just crossed the finishing\nline at the same time. - Yeah.\n- Nobody would watch. - [Lex] Yeah. - And people wouldn't try\nhard to run fast and stuff. So, I think friendly\ncompetition is a good thing. - This is also a good\nplace to give a shout out to a video titled \"The Entire Soviet Rocket\nEngine Family Tree\" by Tim Dodd, AKA Everyday Astronaut. It's like an hour and a half. It gives a full history of Soviet rockets. And people should definitely\ngo check out and support Tim in general, that guy's super\nexcited about the future, super excited about space flight, every time I see anything by\nhim I just have a stupid smile on my face, 'cause he's\nso excited about stuff. - Yeah, Tim Dodd is\n- I love people like that. - really great if you're interested in anything to do with space. He's, in terms of\nexplaining rocket technology to your average person, he's awesome. The Best, I'd say. I should say, the whole\nreason I switched us from, Raptor at one point was\ngonna be a hydrogen engine, but hydrogen has a lot of challenges. It's very low density. It's a deep cryogen, so\nit's only liquid very close to absolute zero. Requires a lot of insulation. So it was a lot of challenges there. And I was actually reading a bit about Russian rocket engine development. At least the impression I had was that Soviet Union, Russia, and\nUkraine primarily were actually in the process\nof switching to Methalux. And there were some interesting\ntest and data for ISP, they were able to get\nup to like a 382nd ISP with the Methalux engine. And I was like, \"Whoa, okay, that's, that's actually really impressive.\" So I think we could,\nyou could actually get a much lower cost, an optimizing cost per ton\nto orbit, cost per to Mars. I think methane option is the way to go. And I was partly inspired\nby the Russian work on the test ends, with Methalux engines. - And now for something\ncompletely different. Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great,\nthe powerful Pewdiepie? Let's say one to 11,\n- Okay. - just go over a few\ndocuments printed out. - [Elon] We can try. - [Lex] Let's try this. I present to you document numero uno. (Elon laughing) - Okay. - [Lex] Vlad The Impaler\ndiscovers marshmallows. - Yeah, that's not bad. - You get it, because he likes impaling things.\n- Yes, I get it. Yes, I get it, I don't\nknow, three, whatever. - [Lex] Oh, that's not very good. This is ground in some\nengineering, some history. (Elon laughing) - Yeah, I give this an 8 out of 10. - [Lex] What do you think\nabout nuclear power? - I'm in favor of nuclear power. In a place that is not subject\nto extreme natural disasters. I think it's a, new nuclear\npower is a great way to generate electricity. I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations. - [Lex] Yeah, but what about Chernobyl? - Exactly. I think people, there's like a lot of fear of radiation and stuff. I guess, the problem is a\nlot of people just don't, they didn't study engineering or physics, so they don't, just the word radiation\njust sounds scary, you know? So they don't, they can't calibrate what radiation means. But radiation is much less\ndangerous than you'd think. For example, Fukushima, when the Fukushima problem happened, due that tsunami. I got people in California\nasking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima. And I'm like, definitely not,\nnot even slightly, not at all. That is crazy. And just to show this is how, the dangers is so much overplayed compared to what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima. And, actually, I donated\na solar power system for a water treatment plant. And I made a point of eating\nlocally grown vegetables on T.V. in Fukushima. I'm still alive. Okay. - So it's not even that the\nrisk of these events is low, but the impact of them is- - The impact is greatly exaggerated. - It' human nature. - People don't know what radiation is, I've had people ask me, \"What about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?\" I'm like, \"When you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?\" They're like, dunno, \"What do\nyou mean photons particles?\" \"Do you mean, let's say photons. What\nfrequency or wavelength?\" And they're like, \"No, I have no idea.\" \"Do you know that everything's\nradiating all the time?\" They're like, \"What do you mean?\" \"Like, everything's\nradiating all the time.\" Photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically. And if you wanna know\nwhat it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside. The sun is a gigantic\nthermonuclear reactor that you're staring right at it. Are you still alive? Yes. Okay. Amazing. - Yeah, I guess radiation\nis one of the words that could be used as a tool to fear monger by certain people. That's it.\n- I think people just don't understand. - I mean, that's the way to\nfight that fear, I suppose, just to understand, just to learn. - Yeah, just say, okay, how many people have actually\ndied from nuclear accidents? It's like practically nothing, and, say how many people have\ndied from coal plants? And it's a very big number. Obviously we should not\nbe starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants, just doesn't make any sense at all. Coal plants, I don't know, a hundred to a thousand times worse for health than nuclear power plants. - You wanna go to the next one? It's really bad. That 90, 180 and 360 degrees,\neverybody loves the math. Nobody gives a shit about 270. - It's not super funny. I don't know, like two or three. - [Lex] Yeah. This is not, LOL situation. (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. (Elon laughing) - That one's pretty good. - [Lex] The United States oscillating between establishing and\ndestroying dictatorships. It's like a metro, is that metro- - Yeah, metronome. Yeah, it's, I dunno, a 7 out of 10. It's kinda true. - This is kinda personal for me. Next one. - Oh, man, is this Laika. - [Lex] Yeah, well, no, this is- - Or it's referring to Laika or something. - [Lex] It's Laika's husband.\n- Husband, yeah. - [Lex] Hello? Yes, this is dog. Your wife was launched into space. And then the last one is\nhim with his eyes closed and a bottle of vodka. - Yeah, Laika didn't come back. - [Lex] No. They don't tell you the full story of, the impact it had on the loved ones. - True.\n- That one gets an 11 from me. It just keeps goin', on the Russian theme. First man in space, nobody cares. First man on the moon. - Well, I think people do care. - [Lex] I know, but. - Yuri Gagarin's name will be\nforever in history. I think. - There is something\nspecial about placing, stepping foot onto another\ntotally foreign land. It's not the journey, like\npeople that explore the oceans. It's not as important\nto explore the oceans as to land in a whole new continent. - [Elon] Yeah. - [Lex] Oh this is about you. (Elon laughing) Oh yeah. I'd love to get\nyour comment on this. Elon Musk after sending $6.6 billion to the UN to end world hunger. \"You have three hours.\" - Yeah, well, I mean obviously $6 billion is not gonna end world hunger. I mean, the reality is at this point the world is producing far more food than it can really consume. We don't have a caloric\nconstraint to this point. So where there is hunger, it is almost always due to civil war, or strife, or some like, it's not a thing that is\nextremely rare for it to be just a matter of, lack of money. There's a civil war in some country, and one part of the\ncountry's literally trying to starve the other part of the country. - So it's much more complex than something that money could solve. It's geopolitics, it's a lot of things, it's human nature, it's governments, it's\nmonies, monetary systems, all that kinda stuff. - Yeah. Food is extremely cheap these days. I mean, the U.S. at this point,\namong low income families, obesity is actually now the problem. It's not, obviously it's not hunger, it's too much, too many calories. It's not that nobody's hungry anywhere, it's just, this is not a simple matter of\nadding money and solving it. - [Lex] What do you think that one gets? Is getting? - Two. - [Lex] Just going after empires. World, \"Where did you\nget those artifacts?\" The British Museum. It's a shout out to \"Monty\nPython.\" \"We found them.\" - Yeah. The British Museum\nis, it's pretty great. I mean, admittedly Britain did take these historical artifacts\nfrom around the world and put them in London, but it's not like people\ncan't go see them. So, it is a convenient place\nto see these ancient artifacts is London, for a large\nsegment of the world. So I think, unbalanced, the British Museum is net good. Well, I'm sure that a lot of countries\nare arguing about that. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's like, you wanna make\nthese historical artifacts accessible to as many people as possible. And the British Museum, I\nthink does a good job of that. - Even if there's a darker\naspect to like the history of empire in general,\nwhatever the empire is, however things were done. It is the history that happened. You can't sort of erase\nthat history, unfortunately. You can just become better in the future. Is the point. - Yeah, I mean, well how are\nwe gonna pass moral judgment on these things? If one is gonna judge,\nsay the Russia Empire, you gotta judge what everyone\nwas doing at the time, and how were the British\nrelative to everyone? And I think that the\nBritish would actually get a relatively good grade,\nrelatively good grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what\neveryone else was doin', they were not the worst. Like I said, you gotta\nlook at these things in the context of the history at the time and say, \"What were the alternatives, and what are you comparing it against?\" - Yes.\n- And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade, when looking\nat history at the time. Now if you judge history from what is morally acceptable today, you're basically are gonna\ngive everyone a failing grade. I'm not clear. I don't think anyone\nwould get a passing grade in their morality of, you\ncould go back 300 years ago, who is getting a passing grade? Basically no one. - [Lex] And we might\nnot get a passing grade from generations\n- Yeah. Exactly. - [Lex] that come after us. What does that one get? - Sure. A six, a seven. - For the \"Monty Python,\" maybe. - [Elon] I always 'Monty\nPython,\" they're great. The \"Life of Brian\" and the\n\"Quest for the Holy Grail\" are incredible. - Yeah. Yeah. - Damn, those are serious eyebrows. - [Lex] Brezhnev. How important, do you think,\n- Damn. - [Lex] is facial hair\nto great leadership? You got a new haircut. How does that affect your leadership? - [Elon] I don't know.\nHopefully not. It doesn't. - [Shivon] Is that the second, no one? - Yeah, the second is no one. - [Elon] There is no one\ncompeting with Brezhnev. - No one two. - Those are like epic eyebrows. Sure. - [Lex] That's ridiculous. - Give it a six or seven, I dunno. - [Lex] I like this,\nShakespeare analysis of memes. - Brezhnev, he had a\nflare for drama as well. German joke. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. It must come from the eyebrows. Alright. Invention, great engineering. Look what I invented. That's the best thing since rip up bread. - Yeah.\n- 'Cause they invented sliced bread. Am I just explaining memes at this point? (all laughing) This is what my life has become. - [Shivon] He's a memelord,\nyou're a meme explainer. - [Lex] I'm a meme, like a scribe, that runs\naround with the kings and just writes down memes. - I mean, when was the\ncheeseburger invented? That's an epic invention. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like, wow. - [Lex] Versus just like a burger? - Or a burger, I guess\na burger in general. - Then there's, what is the burger? What's a sandwich? And then you start getting\nis a pizza a sandwich? And what is the original? It gets into an ontology argument. - Yeah, but everybody knows\nif you order a burger, or cheeseburger, or whatever, and you get tomato and some\nlettuce and onions and whatever, and mayo and ketchup and\nmustard, it's like epic. - Yeah, but I'm sure they've\nhad bread and meat separately for a long time. And it was kind of a\nburger on the same plate, but somebody who actually\ncombined them into the same thing and then bite it and hold\nit, makes it convenient. It's a materials problem. Like your hands don't\nget dirty and whatever. Yeah, it's brill- (Shivon talking faintly) That is not what I would've guessed. - But everyone knows, if\nyou order a cheeseburger, you know what you're getting, it's not like some obtuse,\nwell, I wonder what I'll get. Fries are, I mean, great. I mean, they're the devil,\nbut fries are awesome. Yeah, pizza is incredible. - Food innovation doesn't get enough love. - Yeah.\n- I guess is what we're getting at. - [Elon] It's great. - What about the Matthew\nMcConaughey, Austinite here? President Kennedy, \"Do you know how to put\nmen on the moon yet?\" NASA, \"No.\" President Kennedy, \"Be a\nlot cooler if you did.\" - Pretty much, sure. Six,\nsix or seven, I suppose. - [Lex] And this is the last one. - That's funny. - [Lex] Someone drew a bunch\nof dicks all over the walls. Sistine Chapel, Boys bathroom. - Sure, I'll give it a nine. It's really true. - This is our highest\nranking meme for today. - [Elon] I mean, it's true,\nhow did they get away with it? - Lotsa nakedness. - I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history. As long as people can draw\nthings, there's been a dick pic. - It's a staple of human history. - It's a staple. Consistent throughout human history. - You tweeted that you aspire to comedy, you're friends with Joe Rogan. Might you do a short standup comedy set at some point in the future? Maybe open for Joe? Something like that? Is that- - Really? Stand up? Actual just full-on stand up? - [Lex] Full-on stand up. Is that in there or is that? - I've never thought about that. - It's extremely difficult, at least that's what like Joe\nsays, and the comedians say. - [Elon] Huh? I wonder if I could. - Only one way to find out. - I have done standup for\nfriends, just impromptu, I'll get on like a\nroof, and they do laugh, but they're all friends too. So, I don't know if you\ngot a room of strangers. Are they gonna actually\nalso find it funny, but I could try. See what happens. - I think you'd learn\nsomething either way. - Yeah.\n- I kinda love both when and when you do\ngreat, just watching people, how they deal with it. It's so difficult. You're\nso fragile up there. It's just you. And you think you're gonna be funny and when it completely\nfalls flat, it's just, it's beautiful to see\npeople deal with that. - I think I might have enough\nmaterial to do stand up. I've never thought about it, but I might have enough material. I don't know, like 15\nminutes or something. - Oh yeah. Yeah. Do a Netflix special. (Elon laughing) - [Elon] Netflix special, sure. - What's your favorite\n\"Rick and Morty\" concept? Just to spring that on you,\nis there, there's a lot of sort of scientific\nengineering ideas explored there. There's the,\n- Favorite \"Rick and Morty\" - There's the butter robot. - Yeah, it's a great show. - You like it?\n- Yeah, \"Rick and Morty's\" Awesome. - Somebody that's exactly like you from an alternate\ndimension showed up there. Elon Tusk. - Yeah. That's right.\n- That you voiced. - Yeah, \"Rick and Morty\"\ncertainly explores a lot of interesting concepts. Sure, like what's the favorite one. The butter robot certainly is, it's certainly possible to\nhave too much sentience, in a device. You don't want to have your toaster be a super genius toaster. It's gonna hate life, 'cause all it can make is toast. It's like, you don't wanna\nhave super-intelligence stuck in a very limited device. - Do you think it's too easy, from a, if we're talking about from\nthe engineering perspective, super intelligence, like\nwith Marvin, the robot. It seems like it might\nbe very easy to engineer just a depressed robot. - Sure.\n- It's not obvious to engineer a robot that's going to find a fulfilling existence. Same as humans, I suppose. I wonder if that's like the default, if you don't do a good\njob on building a robot, it's going to be sad a lot. - Well, we can reprogram robots easier than we can reprogram humans. I guess if you let it\nevolve without tinkering, then it might get sad, but you can change the\noptimization function and have it be a cheery robot. - Like I mentioned with SpaceX, you give a lot of people hope, and a lot of people look up to you. Millions of people look up to you. If we think about young\npeople in high school, maybe in college, what advice would you give to them about if they wanna try to do\nsomething big in this world, they wanna really have\na big, positive impact, what advice would you give\nthem about their career, maybe about life in general? - Try to be useful. Do things that are useful\nto your fellow human beings, to the world. It's very hard to be useful. Very hard. Are you contributing\nmore than you consume? Try to have a positive net\ncontribution to society. I think that's the thing to aim for. Not to try to be sort\nof a leader for the sake of being a leader or whatever. A lot of the time people who, a lot of times the people\nyou want as leaders, are the people who don't\nwant to be leaders. If you're living a useful life, that is a good life, a\nlife worth having lived. Like I said, I would encourage people to use the mental tools of physics and apply them broadly in life. They are the best tools. - When you think about\neducation and self-education, what do you recommend? So there's the university,\nthere's self study. There is hands-on, sort\nof finding a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining them as early as possible. There's taking a road trip\nacross Europe for a few years and writing some poetry. Which trajectory do you suggest? In terms of learning about\nhow you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have the most positive impact. - I encourage people to read\na lot of books, just read, basically try to ingest as\nmuch information as you can, and try to also just develop\na good general knowledge. So you at least have a\nrough lay of the land of the knowledge landscape, try to learn a little\nabout a lot of things. 'Cause you might not know\nwhat you're really interested. How would you know what\nyou're really interested in if you at least aren't like doing it? Peripheral exploration broadly\nof the knowledge landscape. And talk to people from\ndifferent walks of life and different industries,\nand professions, and skills, and occupations, like just try. Learn as much as possible. Be on the search for meaning. - Isn't the whole thing\na search for meaning? - Yeah, what's the\nmeaning of life and all? But just generally, like I said, I would encourage people to read broadly in many different subject areas, and then try to find something\nwhere there's an overlap of your talents and what\nyou're interested in. So people may be good at something, or they may have skill\nat a particular thing, but they don't like doing it. So you wanna try to find a thing that's a good combination of the things that you're\ninherently good at, but you also like doing. - And reading as a super fast shortcut to figure out which, where are you, you're both good at it, you like doing it, and it'll\nactually have positive impact. - Well, you gotta learn\nabout things somehow. So reading, a broad range, just really read. More important was as a kid I\nread through the encyclopedia. So, that was pretty helpful. And, there was all sorts of things I didn't even know existed,\nwell lots, obviously. - That's as broad as it gets. - Encyclopedias were suggestible, I think, whatever 40 years ago. Maybe read through like\nthe condensed version of the Encyclopedia Britannica, I'd recommend that. You can always like skip subjects, so you read a few paragraphs and you know you're not interested, just jump to the next one. So, read the encyclopedia,\nor skim through it. I put a lotta stock and\ncertainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts\nin an honest day's work to do useful things. And just generally to have a, not a zero sum mindset, or have more of a grow the pie mindset. When I see people like, perhaps, including some very smart people, kind of taking an attitude of, I like doing things that seem\nlike morally questionable. It's often because they have, at a base sort of axiomatic\nlevel, a zero sum mindset. And they, without realizing it, they don't realize to\nhave a zero sum mindset, or at least they don't\nrealize it consciously. And so, if you have a zero sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others. If the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie. But this is false. Obviously the pie has grown\ndramatically over time, the economic pie. In reality, you can have, (Elon laughing) overuse this analogy,\nwe can have a lot of, there's a lot of pie. (Lex laughing) My pie is not fixed. So, you really wanna make\nsure you're not operating, without realizing it,\nfrom a zero sum mindset. Where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others, then that's gonna result in you trying to take things from\nothers, which is not good. It's much better to work on\nadding to the economic pie. Like I said, creating\nmore than you consume. Doing more than you, yeah. So that's a big deal. I think there's a fair number of people in finance that do have a\nbit of a zero-sum mindset. - I mean, it's all walks of life. I've seen that. One of the reasons Rogan inspires me is he celebrates others a lot, not creating a constant competition like there's a scarcity of resources. And what happens when you celebrate others and you promote others,\nthe ideas of others, it actually grows that pie. The resources become less scarce. And that applies in a\nlot of kinds of domains. It applies in academia where\na lot of people are very, see some funding for academic\nresearch as zero sum. It is not, if you celebrate\neach other, if you make, if you get everybody\nto be excited about AI, about physics, about mathematics, I think there'll be more and more funding, and I think everybody wins. Yeah. That applies, I think, broadly. - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. - So the last question\nabout love and meaning. What is the role of love in\nthe human condition broadly, and more specific to you? How has love, romantic love or otherwise, made you a better person, a better human being? Better engineer? - Now you're asking really\nperplexing questions. It's hard to give a. I mean, there are many books, poems, and songs written\nabout what is love, and what is, what exactly, what is love, baby don't hurt me. (Lex laughing) - That's one of the great ones, yes. You have earlier quoted Shakespeare, but that's really up there. - [Elon] Yeah. Love is a many splendor thing. - I mean, there's, 'cause we've talked about\nso many inspiring things, like be useful in the world,\nsort of solve problems, alleviate suffering, but\nit seems like connection between humans is a source, it's a source of joy,\nit's a source of meaning, and that's what love is, friendship, love. I just wonder if you think\nabout that kind of thing, when you talk about preserving the light of human consciousness. - Right.\n- And us becoming a multi-planetary species. I mean, to me at least, that means, if we're just\nalone, and conscious, and intelligent, it\ndoesn't mean nearly as much as if we're with others. Right? And there's some magic\ncreated when we're together. The friendship of it, and I think the highest\nform of it is love, which I think broadly is much bigger than just sort of romantic, but also yes. Romantic love and family\nand those kinds of things. - Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about us becoming a multi-planet species and a space bearing\ncivilization is foundationally, I love humanity. And so I wish to see it\nprosper and do great things and be happy, and if I did not love humanity, I would not care about these things. - So when you look at the\nwhole, the human history, all of the people whose ever lived, all the people alive now, It's pretty, we're okay. On the whole, we're a\npretty interesting bunch. - Yeah. All things considered, and\nI've read a lot of history, including the darkest, worst parts of it. Despite all that, I think on balance, I still love humanity. - You joked about it, the 42, what do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? Is there a non-numerical representation?\n- Oh, I should say Yeah, well really, I think\nwhat Doug Sanders was saying in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" is that the universe is the answer. What we really need to\nfigure out are what questions to ask about the answer\nthat is the universe. And that the question is\nthe really the hard part. And if you can properly\nframe the question, then the answer, relatively\nspeaking, is easy. So therefore, if you want\nto understand what questions to ask about the university, you wanna understand the meaning of life, we need to expand the scope\nand scale of consciousness so that we're better able\nto understand the nature of the universe and understand\nthe meaning of life. - And ultimately, the most\nimportant part will be to ask the right question. - [Elon] Yes. - Thereby elevating the\nrole of the interviewer - [Elon] Yeah, exactly. - as the most important human in the room. - Good questions are, it's hard to come up with good questions. Absolutely. But yeah, that is the\nfoundation of my philosophy is that I am curious about\nthe nature of the universe. And obviously I will die. I don't know when I'll die,\nbut I won't live forever. But I would like to know\nthat we are on a path to understanding the\nnature of the universe and the meaning of life\nand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. And so if we expand the\nscope and scale of humanity, and consciousness in general, which includes silicon consciousness, then that seems like a\nfundamentally good thing. - Elon, like I said, I'm deeply grateful that you would spend your\nextremely valuable time with me today, and also\nthat you have given millions of people hope in this difficult time, this divisive time and this cynical time. So I hope you do continue\ndoing what you're doing. Thank you so much for talking today. - Oh, you're welcome. Thanks for your excellent questions. - Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Elon Musk. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Elon Musk himself. \"When something is\nimportant enough, you do it, even if the odds are not in your favor.\" Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time.",

    "transcript": "- The following is a conversation\nwith Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew MacDougall, Bliss\nChapman, and Nolan Arbaugh about Neuralink and\nthe future of humanity. Elon, DJ, Matthew and\nBliss are of course part of the amazing Neuralink team, and Noland is the first human to have a Neuralink device\nimplanted in his brain. I speak with each of them individually, so use timestamps to jump around, or as I recommend, go hardcore and listen to the whole thing. This is the longest\npodcast I've ever done. It's a fascinating, super technical, and wide-ranging conversation, and I loved every minute of it. And now, dear friends, here's Elon Musk, his fifth time on this,\n\"The Lex Fridman Podcast.\" - Drinking coffee or water? - Water. I'm so over-caffeinated right now. Do you want some caffeine? - I mean, sure. - There's a Nitro drink. - This supposed to keep you up till like tomorrow afternoon basically. (laughs) - Yeah. I don't have any-\n- So what is Nitro? It's just got a lot of\ncaffeine or something? - Don't ask questions. It's called Nitro. - Do you need to know anything else? - It's got nitrogen, that's ridiculous. I mean, what we breathe\nis 78% nitrogen anyway. What do you need to add more for? (laughs) - [Speaker] Unfortunately,\nyou're gonna need it. - Most people think that\nthey're breathing oxygen, and they're actually\nbreathing 78% nitrogen. You need like a milk bar.\n- Milk bar. (Elon laughing) - Like from Clockwork Orange. (laughs) - Yeah, yeah. Is that top three Kubrick film for you? - Clockwork Orange, it's pretty good. I mean, it's demented. Jarring, I'd say. - (laughs) Okay. Okay, so first let's step back and big congrats on getting Neuralink implanted into a human. That's a historic step for Neuralink. - Oh, thanks, yeah. - There's many more to come. - Yeah, and we just, obviously,\nour second implant as well. - [Lex] How did that go? - So far, so good. Looks like we've got, I think over 400 electrodes\nthat are providing signals. So yeah.\n- Nice. How quickly do you think the number of human participants will scale? - It depends on the regulatory approval, the rate which we get\nregulatory approvals. So we're hoping to do 10\nby the end of this year. Total of 10, so eight more. - And with each one,\nyou're gonna be learning a lot of lessons about the\nnew biology, the brain, everything, the whole\nchain of the Neuralink, the decoding, the signal\nprocessing, all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, yeah, I think it's\nobviously gonna get better with each one. I mean, I don't wanna jinx it, but it seems to have gone extremely well with the second implant,\nso there's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working very well. - What improvements do you think we'll see in Neuralink in the coming, let's say, let's get crazy, the coming years? - I mean, in years,\nit's gonna be gigantic, because we'll increase the number of electrodes dramatically. We'll improve the signal processing. Even with only roughly,\nI don't know, 10, 15% of the electrodes working with Noland, with our first patient, we were able to get to\nachieve a bit per second. That's twice the world record. So I think we'll start\nlike vastly exceeding world record by orders of\nmagnitude in the years to come. So it's start getting to, I don't know, a hundred bits per second thousand. Maybe if like five years from\nnow, we might be at a megabit, like faster than any human\ncould possibly communicate by typing or speaking. - Yeah, that BPS is an\ninteresting metric to measure. There might be a big leap in the experience once you\nreach a certain level of BPS. - [Elon] Yeah. - Like entire new ways of interacting with a computer might be unlocked. - And with humans. - With other humans. - Provided they have (laughs), they want a Neuralink too. - Right. - Otherwise, they won't be able to absorb the signals fast enough. - Do you think they'll improve the quality of intellectual discourse? - Well, I think you could think of it, if you were to slow down communication, how do you feel about that? If you'd only talk at, let's say, 1/10th of normal speed, you'd be like, \"Wow, that's agonizingly slow.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So now, imagine you could speak, communicate clearly at 10 or 100 or 1,000 times faster than normal. - Listen, I'm pretty sure\nnobody in their right mind listens to me at 1x, they listen at 2x. (Elon laughs) I can only imagine what\n10x would feel like or could actually understand it. - I usually default to 1.5x. You can do 2x, but well, actually, if I'm listening to somebody in like sort of 15, 20 minutes\nsegments to go to sleep, then I'll do it 1.5x. If I'm paying attention,\nI'll do 2x. (laughs) - Right. - But actually, if you start\nactually listen to podcasts or sort of audio books or anything, if you get used to doing it at 1.5, then one sounds painfully slow. - I'm still holding onto\none because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself becoming\nbored with the reality, with the real world where\neveryone's speaking on 1x. (both laughing) - Well, depends on the person. You can speak very fast. Like we can communicate very quickly. And also, if you use a wide range of, if your vocabulary is\nlarger, your bit rate, effective bit rate is higher. - That's a good way to put it. - Yeah.\n- The effective bit rate. I mean, that is the question\nis how much information is actually compressed in the\nlow bit transfer of language. - Yeah. If there's a single word\nthat is able to convey something that would normally require, I don't know, 10 simple words, then you've got maybe a 10x\ncompression on your hands. And that's really, like with memes, memes are like data compression. It conveys a whole, you're simultaneously\nhit with a wide range of symbols that you can interpret. And you kinda get it faster\nthan if it were words or a simple picture. - And of course, you're\nreferring to memes broadly like ideas.\n- Yeah. There's an entire idea structure that is like an idea template, and then you can add something\nto that idea template. But somebody has that preexisting idea template in their head. So when you add that\nincremental bit of information, you're conveying much more than a few, just set a few words. It's everything associated with that meme. - You think there'll be\nemergent leaps of capability as you scale the number of electrodes? Like there'll be a certain, you think there'll be like\nactual number where it just, the human experience will be altered? - Yes. - What do you think that number might be, whether electrodes or BPS? We of course don't know for sure, but is this 10,000, 100,000? - Yeah, I mean certainly,\nif you're anywhere at 10,000 bits per second,\nI mean, that's vastly faster than any human could\ncommunicate right now. If you think about what is the average bits per second of a human? It is less than one bit per\nsecond over the course of a day, because there are 86,400 seconds in a day. And you don't communicate\n86,400 tokens in a day. Therefore, your bits per\nsecond is less than one, averaged over 24 hours. It's quite slow. And now, even if you're\ncommunicating very quickly, and you're talking to\nsomebody who understands what you're saying, because\nin order to communicate, you have to at least, to some degree, model the mind state of the\nperson to whom you're speaking. Then take the concept\nyou're trying to convey, compress that into a\nsmall number of syllables, speak them, and hope that the other person decompresses them into\na conceptual structure that is as close to what you\nhave in your mind as possible. - Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of signal loss there in that process. - Yeah, very lousy\ncompression and decompression. And a lot of what your neurons are doing is distilling the concepts down to a small number of\nsymbols of, say, syllables that I'm speaking, or keystrokes,\nwhatever the case may be. So that's a lot of what your\nbrain computation is doing. Now, there is an argument\nthat that's actually a healthy thing to do\nor a helpful thing to do because as you try to\ncompress complex concepts, you're perhaps forced to distill what is most essential in those concepts as opposed to just all the fluff. So in the process of compression, you distill things down\nto what matters the most, because you can only say a few things. So that is perhaps helpful. I think we might, we'll probably get, if our data rate increases,\nit's highly probable that we'll become far more verbose. Just like your computer, when computers had like, my first computer had 8K of RAM, so you really thought about every byte. And now you've got computers with many gigabytes of RAM. So if you wanna do an iPhone app that just says 'Hello world,' it's probably, I don't know, several megabytes minimum. (laughs) A bunch of fluff. But nonetheless, we still\nprefer to have the computer with more memory and more compute. So the long-term aspiration of Neuralink is to improve the AI human symbiosis by increasing the bandwidth\nof the communication, because even in the most\nbenign scenario of AI, you have to consider that the\nAI is simply gonna get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words. I mean, if the AI can communicate\nit to terabits per second and you're communicating\nit bits per second, it's like 203. - Well, it is a very interesting question for a super intelligent species. What use are humans? - I think there is some\nargument for humans as a source of will. - Will?\n- Will, yeah. Source of will or purpose. So if you consider the human\nmind as being essentially, there's the primitive limbic elements, which basically even like reptiles have, and there's the cortex, that's the thinking and\nplanning part of the brain. Now, the cortex is much\nsmarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in\nservice to the limbic system. It's trying to make the\nlimbic system happy. I mean, the sheer amount of compute that's gone into people\ntrying to get laid is insane, without actually seeking procreation. They're just literally trying to do this sort of simple motion. (laughs) And they get a kick out of it. So this simple, which in the\nabstract rather absurd motion, which is sex, the cortex\nis putting a massive amount of compute into trying to\nfigure out how to do that. - So like 90% of distributed\ncompute of the human species is spent on trying to get laid, probably, like a massive amount.\n- Large percent, yeah, yeah. There's no purpose to most\nsex except hedonistic. It's just sort of joy or whatever. Dopamine release. Now, once in a while, it's procreation, but for humans, modern humans,\nit's mostly recreational. So your cortex, much smarter\nthan your limbic system, is trying to make the limbic system happy 'cause the limbic system\nwants to have sex, or want some tasty food or\nwhatever the case may be. And then that is then further augmented by the tertiary system, which\nis your phone, your laptop, iPad, whatever, or your computing stuff. That's your tertiary layer. So you're actually already a cyborg. You have this tertiary compute layer, which is in the form of your computer with all the applications\nor your compute devices. And so in the getting laid front, there's actually a massive\namount of digital compute also trying to get laid, with\nlike Tinder and whatever. - Yeah. So the compute that\nwe've humans have built is also participating. (laughs) - Yeah, I mean, there's\nlike gigawatts of compute going into getting laid,\nof digital compute. - Yeah. (laughs) What if AGI will-\n- This is happening as we speak. - If we merge with AI, it's\njust gonna expand the compute that we humans use-\n- Pretty much. - To try to get laid.\n- Well, that's one of the things, certainly, yeah. - Yeah. - But what I'm saying is that yes, is there a use for humans? Well, there's this fundamental question of what's the meaning of life? Why do anything at all? And so if our simple limbic\nsystem provides a source of will to do something, that\nthen goes to our cortex, that then goes to our\ntertiary compute layer, then I don't know, it might\nactually be that the AI in a benign scenario simply trying to make the human limbic system happy. - Yeah, it seems like the will is not just about the limbic system. There's a lot of interesting,\ncomplicated things in there. We also want power. - That's limbic too, I think. - But then we also want to,\nin a kind of cooperative way, alleviate the suffering in the world. - Not everybody does, but yeah, sure. Some people do. - As a group of humans,\nwhen we get together, we start to have this kind\nof collective intelligence that is more complex in its will than the underlying individual\ndescendants of apes, right? So there's like other motivations. And that could be a\nreally interesting source of an objective function for AGI. - Yeah, I mean, there\nare these sort of fairly cerebral or kind of higher level goals. I mean, for me it's like, what's the meaning of life, or understanding the\nnature of the universe is of great interest to me. And hopefully, to AI. And that's the mission of xAI and Grok is understand the universe. - So do you think people, when you have a Neuralink\nwith 10,000, 100,000 channels, most of the use cases will be\ncommunication with AI systems? - Well, assuming there are not, I mean, they're solving\nbasic neurological issues that people have if\nthey've got damaged neurons in their spinal cord or neck or, you know, as is the case with\nthe first two patients, then there's obviously, the first order of business is solving fundamental neuron\ndamage in a spinal cord, neck, or in the brain itself. A second product is called Blindsight, which is to enable people\nwho are completely blind, lost both eyes or optic nerve, or just can't see at all to be able to see by directly triggering the\nneurons in the visual cortex. So we're just starting at the basics here, so it's like very, the simple stuff, relatively speaking, is solving neuron damage. It can also solve I think\nprobably schizophrenia. If people have seizures of some kind, it could probably solve that. It could help with memory. There's like a kind of a\ntech tree, if you will, of like you got the basics. Like you need literacy before you can have \"Lord of the Rings.\" (both laughing) - Got it. - Do you have letters and alphabet? Okay, great. Words? Then eventually get soggy. So I think there's that\nthere may be some things to worry about in the future. But the first several years are really just solving\nbasic neurological damage. Like for people who have\nessentially complete or near complete loss of,\nfrom the brain to the body. Like Stephen Hawking would be an example. The Neuralink would be\nincredibly profound, 'cause I mean, you can\nimagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate as fast\nas we're communicating, perhaps faster. And that's certainly possible. Probable, in fact, likely I'd say. - So there's a kind of dual track of medical and non-medical, meaning, so everything you've talked\nabout could be applied to people who are non-disabled in the future? - The logical thing to do is, sensible thing to do\nis to start off solving basic neuron damage issues. - [Lex] Yes. - 'Cause there's obviously\nsome risk with a new device. You can't get the risk down at zero. It's not possible. So you wanna have the\nhighest possible reward, given there's a certain irreducible risk. And if somebody's able to have a profound improvement\nin their communication, that's worth the risk. - As you get the risk down. - Yeah, as you get the risk down. Once the risk is down to, you know, if you have like thousands of people that have been using it for years and the risk is minimal,\nthen perhaps at that point, you could consider saying, \"Okay, let's aim for augmentation.\" Now, I think we're actually\ngonna aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage. So we're not just aiming to\ngive people communication data rate equivalent to normal humans. We're aiming to give people\nwho have quadriplegic or maybe have complete\nloss of the connection to the brain and body, a\ncommunication data rate that exceeds normal humans,\ngoing, \"Well, we're in there. Why not? Let's give people superpowers.\" - And the same for vision. As you restore vision,\nthere could be aspects of that restoration that are superhuman? - Yeah, at first, the vision\nrestoration will be low res, 'cause you have to say like, \"How many neurons can you\nput in there and trigger? And you can do things where\nyou adjust the electric field to like, even if you've\ngot, say, 10,000 neurons, it's not just 10,000 pixels because you can adjust the\nfeel between the neurons and do them in patterns in order to get, so have, say, 10,000 electrodes\neffectively give you, I don't know, maybe\nlike having a megapixel or a 10 megapixel situation. And then over time, I think you get to higher resolution than human eyes. And you could also see\nin different wavelengths. So like Geordi La Forge from \"Star Trek.\" Like the thing. You wanna see in radar? No problem. You could see ultraviolet, infrared, eagle vision, whatever you want. - Do you think there'll be, let me ask a Joe Rogan question. Do you think there'll be, (laughs) I just recently taken ayahuasca. - Is that a Rogan question?\n- No. Well, yes.\n- Well, I guess, technically it is. - Yeah.\n- Ever tried GMT, bro? (both laughing) - I love you, Joe.\n- Okay. (laughing continues) - But wait, wait, yeah. Have you said much about it? The ayahuasca?\n- I've not, I've not. I've not.\n- Okay, well, why are you spilling the beans? (Lex laughing) It was a truly incredible thing- - Turn the tables on you. (both laughing) - Wow, okay.\n- You're in the jungle. - [Lex] Yeah, amongst\nthe trees myself and- - Yeah, must been crazy.\n- And the shaman. Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the insects, with the animals all around you, like jungle as far as I can see. There's no-\n- I mean- - That's the way to do it. - Things are gonna look pretty wild. - Yeah, pretty wild. (Elon laughing) - I think in extremely high dose. - Just don't go hugging an\nanaconda or something. (laughs) - You haven't lived unless\nyou made love to an anaconda. I'm sorry, but- - Snakes and ladders. (both laughing) - Yeah, I took a extremely high dose of- - [Elon] Okay. (laughs) - Nine cups and-\n- Damn. Okay, that sounds like a lot. Of course, is Noland's one cup or- - One or two. Usually, one. - You went, wait. Like right off the bat, or did\nyou work your way up to it? - So I-\n(both laughing) - You're just jumping at the deep end. - Across two days, 'cause\nthen the first day, I took two and I-\n- Okay. - It was a ride, but\nit wasn't quite like a- - It wasn't like revelation. - It wasn't into deep space type ride. It was just like a little airplane ride. - [Elon] (laughs) Okay. - Saw some trees and some\nvisuals and all that. I just saw a dragon,\nall that kind of stuff. But-\n(laughs) - It's nine cups. You went to Pluto, I think. - [Lex] Pluto, yeah. No, deep space. - Deep space. - No, one of the interesting\naspects of my experience is I thought I would have some demons, some stuff to work through. - That's what people- - That's what everyone says. - That's what everyone says. Yeah, exactly.\n- I had nothing. I had it all positive. I just-\n- Oh, just pure soul. - I don't think so, I don't know. (laughs) But I kept thinking about, it had like extremely high resolution, thoughts about the\npeople I know in my life. You were there.\n- Okay. - And it's just not from my\nrelationship with that person, but just as the person themselves, I had just this deep\ngratitude of who they are. - That's cool.\n- It was just like this exploration, like Sims or whatever, you get to watch them.\n- Sure. - I got to watch people and just be in awe of\nhow amazing they are. - That sounds awesome.\n- Yeah, it was great. I was waiting for-\n- When's Steven coming? (both laughing) - Exactly. Maybe I'll have some negative thoughts. Nothing, nothing. Just extreme gratitude for them. And then also, a lot of space travel. (both laughing) - Space travel to where? - So here's what it was. It was people, the human\nbeings that I know, they had this kinda, the best way to describe it\nis they had a glow to them. And then I kept flying out\nfrom them to see earth, to see our solar system,\nto see our galaxy. And I saw that light, that\nglow all across the universe. Like whatever that form is. whatever that like- - [Elon] Did you go past the Milky Way? - Yeah, yeah.\n- Okay. You're like intergalactic. - Yeah, intergalactic.\n- Okay, dang. - But always pointing in-\n- Okay. - Yeah, past the Milky way. I mean, I saw like a\nhuge number of galaxies, intergalactic, and all of it was glowing. But I couldn't control that chill, 'cause I would actually\nexplore near distances to the solar system, see if there's aliens or any of that kinda stuff. I didn't know-\n- Is there aliens? Zero aliens?\n- Implication of aliens because they were glowing. They were glowing in the same\nway that humans were glowing. That like life force that I was seeing, the thing that made humans amazing was there throughout the universe. Like there was these glowing dots. So I don't know. It made me feel like there is life. No, not life, but something, whatever makes humans amazing\nall throughout the universe. - Sounds good.\n- Yeah, it was amazing. No demons, no demons. I looked for the demons. There's no demons. There were dragons, and\nthey're pretty awesome. So the thing about- - Was there anything scary at all? - Dragons? But they weren't scary. They were friends, they were protective. So the thing is-\n- \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\" - No, it was more like a \"Game\nof Thrones\" kind of dragons. They weren't very friendly. They were very big. So the thing is that,\nwell, giant trees at night, which is where I was.\n- Yeah. I mean, the jungle's kinda scary. - Yeah, the trees started\nto look like dragons, and they were all like looking at me. - Sure, okay.\n- And it didn't seem scary. They seemed like they were protecting me. And the shaman and the people\ndidn't speak any English, by the way, which made it\neven scarier I guess. (laughs) We're not even like, you know, we're worlds apart in many ways. But yeah, they talk about\nthe mother of the forest protecting you, and\nthat's what I felt like. - And you're way out in the jungle? - Way out. This is not like a tourist retreat. - Like 10 miles outside\nof a Rio or something? - No, we went- (both laughing) No, this is not-\n- Deep in the Amazon. - Me and this guy named Paul Rosolie who basically is Tarzan. He lives in the jungle. We went out deep and we just went crazy. - Wow, cool.\n- Yeah. So anyway, can I get that same\nexperience within Neuralink? - Probably, yeah. - I guess that is the question\nfor non-disabled people. Do you think that there's\na lot in our perception, in our experience of the\nworld that could be explored, that could be played with using Neuralink? - Yeah, I mean, Neuralink is, it's really a generalized\ninput-output device. It's reading electrical signals and generating electrical signals. And I mean, everything that\nyou've ever experienced in your whole life, the smell, emotions, all of those are electrical signals. So it's kinda weird to\nthink that your entire life experience is distilled down to electrical signals for neurons. But that is in fact the case. Or I mean, that's at least what all the evidence points to. So I mean, if you\ntrigger the right neuron, you could trigger a particular scent. You could certainly make things glow. I mean, do pretty much anything. I mean, really, you can think of the brain as a biological computer. So if there are certain,\nsay, chips or elements of that biological\ncomputer that are broken, let's say your ability to,\nif you've got a stroke, that if you've had a stroke, that means you got, some part\nof your brain is damaged. If that, let's say,\nit's a speech generation or the ability to move your left hand. That's the kind of thing\nthat a Neuralink could solve. If you've got like a massive amount of memory loss that's just gone, well, we can't get the memories back. We could restore your\nability to make memories, but we can't restore\nmemories that are fully gone. Now, I should say, maybe if\npart of the me memory is there and the means of accessing memory is the part that's broken,\nthen we could re-enable the ability to access the memory. But you can think of it\nlike RAM in a computer. If the RAM is destroyed or\nyour SD card is destroyed, we can't get that back. But if the connection to\nthe SD card is destroyed, we can fix that. If it is fixable physically, then yeah, then it can be fixed. - Of course, with AI, you can just like, you can repair photographs and fill in the missing\nparts of photographs. Maybe you can do the same, just like- - Yeah, you could say like, \"Create the most probable set of memories based on all information\nyou have about that person.\" You could then, it would be probabilistic\nrestoration of memory. Now, we're getting pretty esoteric here. - But that is one of the\nmost beautiful aspects of the human experience is\nremembering the good memories. Like we live most of our life, as Danny Kahneman has talked about, in our memories, not in the actual moment. We're collecting memories and we kind of relive them in our head. And that's the good times. If you just integrate\nover our entire life, it's remembering the good times that produces the largest\namount of happiness. And so-\n- Yeah, well, I mean, what are we but our memories? And what is death but the loss of memory, loss of information? If you could say like,\nwell, if you could be, you run a thought experiment, if you were disintegrated painlessly and then reintegrated a moment later, like teleportation, I guess, provided there's no information loss, the fact that your one body was\ndisintegrated is irrelevant. - And memories is just\nsuch a huge part of that. - Death is fundamentally\nthe loss of information, the loss of memory. - So if we can store them\nas accurately as possible, we basically achieve\na kind of immortality. - Yeah. - You've talked about the threats, the safety concerns of AI. Let's look at long-term visions. Do you think Neuralink is, in your view, the best current approach\nwe have for AI safety? - It's an idea that may\nhelp with AI safety. Certainly not, I wouldn't wanna claim\nit's like some panacea or that's a sure thing. But I mean, many years\nago, I was thinking like, \"Well, what would inhibit\nalignment of collective human will with artificial intelligence and the low data rate of humans, especially our slow output\nrate would necessarily just, because the communication is so slow, would diminish the link\nbetween humans and computers? Like the more you are a tree, the less you know what a tree is. Like let's say you look at a tree, you look at this plant\nor whatever and like, \"Hey, I'd really like to\nmake that plant happy.\" But it's not saying a lot, you know? - So the more we increase the data rate that humans can intake and output, then that means the\nhigher the chance we have in a world full of AGIs? - Yeah. We could better align\ncollective human will with AI if the output rate especially\nwas dramatically increased. And I think there's potential to increase the output rate by, I don't know, three, maybe six, maybe\nmore orders of magnitude. So it's better than the current situation. - And that output rate would be by increasing the number of\nelectrodes, number of channels, and also maybe implanting\nmultiple Neuralinks? - Yeah. - Do you think there'll be a world in the next couple of decades where it's hundreds of millions\nof people have Neuralinks? - Yeah, I do. - You think when people just, when they see the capabilities,\nthe superhuman capabilities that are possible and then\nthe safety is demonstrated? - Yeah, if it's extremely safe and you can have superhuman abilities, and let's say you can\nupload your memories, so you wouldn't lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it. It would supersede the\ncell phone, for example. I mean, the biggest problem\nthat a say a phone has is trying to figure out what you want. So that's why you've got auto complete and you've got output, which is all the pixels on the screen. But from the perspective of the human, the output is so freaking slow. Desktop or phone is desperately just trying to understand what you want, and there's an eternity\nbetween every keystroke from a computer standpoint. - Yeah? The computer's talking to a tree that slow moving tree\nthat's trying to swipe. - Yeah. So if you have computers that are doing trillions of instructions per second, and a whole second went by,\nI mean, that's a trillion things it could have done. - Yeah, I think it's\nexciting and scary for people because once you have\na very high bit rate, that changes the human experience in a way that's very hard to imagine. - Yeah. It would be something different. I mean, some sort of futuristic sidewalk. I mean, we're obviously\ntalking about, by the way, it's not like around the corner. You ask me what the\ndistant future was like. Maybe this is like,\nit's not super far away, but 10, 15 years, that kind of thing. (Lex sighs) - When can I get one? 10 years? - Probably less than 10 years. Depends what you wanna do. - Hey, if I can get like a thousand BPS- - A thousand bps when? - And it's safe and I can just interact with the computer while laying\nback and eating Cheetos, I don't eat Cheetos. There's certain aspects of\nhuman-computer interaction when done more efficiently\nand more enjoyably, like worth it. - Well, we feel pretty confident that I think maybe within the next year or two, that someone with a Neuralink implant will be able to outperform a pro gamer. - Nice. - Because the reaction\ntime would be faster. - I got to visit Memphis. - Yeah, yeah.\n- You're going big on compute. - Yeah.\n- You've also said play to win or don't play at all, so what does it take to win? - For AI, that means you've gotta have the most powerful training compute, and the rate of improvement\nof training compute has to be faster than everyone\nelse or you will not win. Your AI will be worse. - So how can Grok, let's say, three that might be available,\nwhat, like next year? - Well, hopefully, end of this year. - Grok 3?\n- If we're lucky, yeah. - How can that be the best LLM, the best AI system available in the world? How much of it is compute? How much of it is data? How much of it is like post-training? How much of it is the product\nthat you packaged it up in? All that kind of stuff. - I mean, they won't matter. It's sort of like saying, let's say it's a Formula One race. Like what matters more,\nthe car or the driver? I mean, they both matter. If a car is not fast, then\nif it's like, let's say, it's half the horsepower\nof your competitors, the best driver will still lose. If it's twice the horsepower, then probably even a mediocre\ndriver will still win. So the training compute\nis kinda like the engine, how many is this horsepower of the engine. So really, you wanna try\nto do the best on that. Then how efficiently do you\nuse that training compute? And how efficiently do\nyou do the inference, the use of the AI? So obviously, that comes\ndown to human talent. And then what unique\naccess to data do you have? That also plays a role. - You think Twitter data will be useful? - Yeah, I mean, I think, I think most of the leading AI companies have already scraped all the Twitter data. Not I think they have. So on a go forward basis,\nwhat's useful is the fact that it's up to the second. That's hard for them\nto scrape in real time. So there's an immediacy\nadvantage that Grok has already. I think with Tesla and the real time video coming from several million cars, ultimately, tens of millions\nof cars, with Optimus, there might be hundreds of\nmillions of Optimus robots, maybe billions learning\na tremendous amount from the real world. That's the biggest source of data I think ultimately is sort of Optimus. Optimus is gonna be the\nbiggest source of data. - Because-\n- 'Cause reality scales. Reality scales to the scale of reality. It's actually humbling\nto see how little data humans have actually\nbeen able to accumulate. Really, you see how many trillions of usable tokens have humans generated, where on a non-duplicative, like discounting spam\nand repetitive stuff, it's not a huge number. You run out pretty quickly. - And Optimus can go, so Tesla cars can unfortunately have\nto stay on the road. Optimus robot can go anywhere, and there's more reality off\nthe road and go off road. - I mean, except for the store, where I can like pick up the cup and see, did it pick up the cup in the right way? Did it pour water in the cup? Did the water go in the\ncup or not go in the cup? Did it spill water or not? - [Lex] Yeah. - Simple stuff like that. But it can do at that\nscale times a billion, so generate useful data from reality. So cause and effect stuff. - What do you think it takes to get to mass production of\nhumanoid robots like that? - It's the same as cars, really. I mean, global capacity for vehicles is about a hundred million a year. And it could be higher. It's just that the demand is on the order of a\nhundred million a year. And then there's roughly\ntwo billion vehicles that are in use in some\nway, which makes sense. Like the life of a\nvehicle is about 20 years, so it's steady state. You can have a hundred million\nvehicles produced a year with a two billion vehicle fleet roughly. Now for humanoid robots,\nthe utility is much greater. So my guess is humanoid\nrobots are more like at a billion plus per year. - But until you came along\nand started building Optimus, it was thought to be an\nextremely difficult problem. I mean, it still-\n- Well, it is. - Extremely difficult.\n- So walk in the park. I mean, Optimus currently would struggle to walk in the park. I mean, it can walk in a park. The park is not too difficult, but it will be able to walk over a wide range of terrain. - And pick up objects.\n- Yeah, yeah. It can already do that. - [Lex] But like all kinds of objects? - Yeah, yeah.\n- All foreign objects. I mean, pouring water in\na cup does not thrill you, 'cause then if you don't know\nanything about the container, it could be all kinds of containers. - Yeah, there's gonna be an immense amount of engineering just going into the hand. The hand might be, it\nmight be close to half of all the engineering in Optimus. From an electromechanical standpoint, the hand is probably roughly\nhalf of the engineering. - But so much of the intelligence, so much the intelligence of humans goes into what we do with our hands. - Yeah. - It's the manipulation of the world, manipulation of objects in the world. Intelligence is safe manipulation of objects in the world, yeah. - Yeah. I mean, you start really thinking about your hand and how it works. - I do all the time. - The sensory control homonculus is where you have humongous hands. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I mean, like your hands, the actuators, the muscles of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm. So your forearm has the muscles that actually control your hand. There's a few small\nmuscles in the hand itself, but your hand is really\nlike a skeleton meat puppet. And with cables. So the muscles that control\nyour fingers are in your forearm and they go through the carpal tunnel, which is that you've got a\nlittle collection of bones and a tiny tunnel that these\ncables, the tendons go through. And those tendons are\nmostly what move your hands. - And something like those tendons has to be re-engineered into the Optimus in order to do all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, so like the current Optimus, we tried putting the\nactuators in the hand itself, but then you sort of end\nup having these like- - Giant hands? - Yeah, giant hands that look weird. And then they don't actually\nhave enough degrees of freedom and/or enough strength. So then you realize, \"Oh, okay, that's why you gotta put the\nactuators in the forearm.\" And just like a human,\nyou gotta run cables through a narrow tunnel\nto operate the fingers. And then there's also a reason for not having all the\nfingers the same length. So it wouldn't be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your fingers\nbe the same length. So why not do the same length? - Yeah, why not? - Because it's actually better\nto have different lengths. Your dexterity is better if you've got fingers at different length. There are more things you can do. And your dexterity is actually better if your fingers are a different length. Like there's a reason\nwe've got a little finger. Like why not have little\nfinger this bigger? - Yeah.\n- 'Cause it allows you to do, it helps you with fine motor skills. - This little finger helps? - It does.\n- Hmm. (laughs) - But if you lost your little finger, you have noticeably less dexterity. - So as you're figuring out this problem, you have to also figure out a way to do it so you can mass manufacture it. So it's to be as simple as possible. - It's actually gonna\nbe quite complicated. The as possible part is\nit's quite a high bar. If you wanna have a humanoid\nrobot that can do things that a human can do, it's a very high bar. So our new arm has 22 degrees\nof freedom instead of 11 and has the actuators in the forearm. And all the actuators are\ndesigned from scratch, from physics first principles. The sensors are all designed from scratch. And we'll continue to\nput a tremendous amount of engineering effort\ninto improving the hand. By hand, I mean like the entire\nforearm from elbow forward is really the hand. So that's incredibly difficult\nengineering actually. And so the simplest possible\nversion of a humanoid robot that can do even most, perhaps not all, of what a human can do is\nactually still very complicated. It's not simple. It's very difficult. - Can you just speak to what it takes for a great engineering team for you? What I saw in Memphis,\nthe supercomputer cluster is just this intense drive\ntowards simplifying the process, understanding the process,\nconstantly improving it, constantly iterating it. - Well, (laughs) it's\neasy to say simplify, and it's very difficult to do it. I have this very basic\nfirst principles algorithm that I run kind of as like a mantra, which is to first\nquestion the requirements, make the requirements less dumb. The requirement is always\ndumb to some degree. So if you wanna start off\nby reducing the number of requirements, and no matter how smart the person is who gave\nyou those requirements, they're still dumb to some degree. You have to start there because otherwise, you could get the perfect\nanswer to the wrong question. So try to make the question\nthe least wrong possible. That's what question\nthe requirements means. And then the second thing is try to delete whatever the step is. The part or the process\nstep sounds very obvious, but people often forget to\ntry deleting it entirely. And if you're not forced\nto put back at least 10% of what you'd delete,\nyou're not deleting enough. And somewhat illogically,\npeople often, most of the time, feel as though they've succeeded if they've not been forced\nto put things back in. But actually, they haven't because they've been overly conservative and have left things in\nthere that shouldn't be. And only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it. Again, these all sound I think\nvery obvious when I say them, but the number of times\nI've made these mistakes is more than I care to remember. That's why I have this mantra. So in fact, I'd say that\nthe most common mistake of smart engineers is to optimize a thing that should not exist. - Right. So like you say, you run\nthrough the algorithm and basically show up to a problem, show up to the supercomputer cluster and see the process and\nask, \"Can this be deleted?\" - Yeah, first try to delete it. Yeah. - Yeah, that's not easy to do. - No, and actually, what\ngenerally makes people uneasy is that you've gotta delete\nat least some of the things that you'd delete, you will put back in. But going back to sort of\nwhere our limbic system can steer us wrong is\nthat we tend to remember, with sometimes a jarring level of pain, where we deleted something\nthat we subsequently needed. And so people will remember that one time, they forgot to put in\nthis thing three years ago and that caused them trouble. And so they overcorrect, and then they put too much stuff in there and over complicate things. So you actually have to say, \"No, we're deliberately gonna\ndelete more than we should.\" So we're putting at least 1 in 10 things, we're gonna add back in. - And I've seen you suggest just that, that something should be deleted and you can kind of see the pain. - Oh yeah, absolutely. - Everybody feels a\nlittle bit of the pain. - Absolutely, and I tell 'em in advance, like, yeah, some of the\nthings that we delete, we're gonna put back in. And that people get a\nlittle shook by that. But it makes sense because\nif you're so conservative as to never have to put anything back in, you obviously have a lot\nof stuff that isn't needed. So you gotta overcorrect. This is, I would say, like a cortical override\nto Olympic instinct. - One of many that\nprobably leaves us astray. - Yeah. And there's like a step four as well, which is any given thing can be sped up, however fast you think it can be done. Like whatever the speed is being done, it can be done faster. But you shouldn't speed\nthings up until it's off, until you've tried to\ndelete it and optimize. Otherwise, you're speeding up something that shouldn't exist is absurd. And then the fifth\nthing is to automate it. - Damn. - And I've gone backwards so many times where I've automated\nsomething, sped it up, simplified it, and then deleted it. And I got tired of doing that. So that's why I've got this mantra that is a very effective\nfive-step process. It works great. - Well, when you've already automated, deleting must be real painful. - Yeah, that's great. It's like, wow, I really\nwasted a lot of effort there. - Yeah. - I mean, what you've\ndone with the cluster in Memphis is incredible, just in a handful of weeks. - Yeah, it's not working yet. So I don't wanna pop the champagne corks. In fact, I have a call in a few hours with the Memphis team 'cause we're having some\npower fluctuation issues. So yeah, it's like kind of a, when you do synchronized training, you've all these computers\nthat are training where the training is synchronized to the sort of millisecond level. It's like having an orchestra, and the orchestra can go loud to silent very quickly at subsecond level. And then the electrical system kind of freaks out about that. Like if you suddenly see giant shifts, 10, 20 megawatts several times a second, this is not what electrical\nsystems are expecting to see. - So that's one of the main\nthings you have to figure out the cooling, the power, and then on the software\nas you go up the stack on how to do the distributed compute, all of that, all of that. - Today's problem is dealing\nwith extreme power jitter. - Jitter, power jitter.\n- Yeah. - That's a nice ring to that. So that's, okay. And you stayed up late into the\nnight as you often do there. - Last week, yeah. - Last week?\n- Yeah. We finally got to go training\ngoing at, oddly enough, roughly 4:20 AM last Monday. - Total coincidence. - Yeah, I mean, maybe\nit was 422 or something. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that universe again with the jokes. - Yeah, exactly, just love it. - I mean, I wonder if you\ncould speak to the fact that one of the things that\nyou did when I was there is you went through all the steps of what everybody's doing, Just to get a sense that\nyou yourself understand it and everybody understands it so they can understand\nwhen something is dumb or some something is inefficient or that kinda stuff.\n- Yeah. - Can you speak to that? - Yeah, so look, I try to do, whatever the people at\nthe front lines are doing, I try to do it at least\na few times myself. So connecting fiber optic cables, diagnosing a faulty connection, that tends to be the limiting factor for large training\nclusters is the cabling. So many cables, because for\na coherent training system where you've got RDMA\nremote, direct memory access, the whole thing is like one giant brain. So you've got to any connection. So any GPU can talk to\nany GPU out of 100,000. That is a crazy cable layout. - It looks pretty cool.\n- Yeah. - It's like the human brain, but like at a scale that\nhumans can visibly see. It is brain.\n- Yeah. I mean, the human brain also has, a massive amount of the\nbrain tissue is the cables. - [Lex] Yeah. - So like the gray matter\nwhich is the compute, and then the white matter which is cables. The big percentage of\nyour brain is just cables. - That's what it felt like walking around in the supercomputer center is like, we're walking around inside the brain. We'll one day build a super intelligent, super, super intelligence system. Do you think-\n- Yeah? - Do you think there's a chance that xAI, that you are the one that builds AGI? - It's possible. What do you define as AGI? - I think humans will never acknowledge that AGI has been built. - Keep moving the goalposts. - Yeah. So I think there's already\nsuperhuman capabilities that are available in AI systems. I think what AGI is when it's smarter than the collective intelligence of the entire human species in our- - Well, I think that,\nyeah, that only people would call that sort of ASI or artificial super intelligence. But there are these thresholds\nwhere you could say, at some point, the AI is\nsmarter than any single human. And then you've got eight billion humans. And actually, each human is machine augmented by the computers. It's a much higher bar to\ncompete with eight billion machine-augmented humans. That's a whole bunch of\norders, magnitude more. But at a certain point, yeah, the AI will be smarter\nthan all humans combined. - If you are the one to do it, do you feel the responsibility of that? - Yeah, absolutely. And I wanna be clear. Let's say, if xAI is first,\nthe others won't be far behind. I mean, they might be six months behind or a year maybe, not even that. - So how do you do it in a way that doesn't hurt humanity, do you think? - So, I mean, I've thought\nabout AI for a long time, and the thing that at least\nmy biological neural net comes up with as being\nthe most important thing is adherence to truth, whether that truth is\npolitically correct or not. So I think if you force AI to\nlie, you train them to lie, you're really asking for trouble, even if that lie is done\nwith good intentions. So I mean, you saw sort of issues with ChatGPT and Gemini and whatnot. Like you asked Gemini for an image of the founding fathers\nof the United States. And it shows a group of diverse women. Now, that's factually untrue. So now, that's sort of like a silly thing, but if an AI is programmed\nto say like diversity is a necessary output function, and then it becomes sort of\nthis omnipowerful intelligence, it could say, \"Okay, well,\ndiversity is now required. And if there's not enough diversity, those who don't fit the\ndiversity requirements will be executed.\" If it's programmed to do that as the fundamental utility function, it'll do whatever it\ntakes to achieve that. So you have to be very careful about that. That's where I think you\nwanna just be truthful. Rigorous adherence to\ntruth is very important. I mean, another example\nis, if you had to ask, Paris.AI is I think all of them. And I'm not saying Grok is perfect here. \"Is it worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner, or global thermonuclear war?\" And it said, \"It's worse to\nmisgender Caitlyn Jenner.\" Now, even Caitlyn Jenner\nsaid, \"Please misgender me.\" That is insane. But if you've got that kind\nof thing programmed in, AI could conclude something\nabsolutely insane, like in order to avoid\nany possible misgendering, all humans must die, because then, the misgendering is not possible because there are no humans. There are these absurd things\nthat are nonetheless logical if that's what you programmed it to do. So in \"2001: Space Odyssey,\" what Odyssey clock was trying to say, one of the things he\nwas trying to say there was that you should not program AI to lie, 'cause essentially, the AI\nHAL 9000 was programmed to, it was told to take the\nastronauts to the monolith, but also, they could not\nknow about the monolith. So it concluded that it will kill them and take them to the monolith. It brought them to the monolith. They're dead but they do\nnot know about the monolith. Problem solved. That is why it would not\nopen the podbay doors. It was this classic scene of like, \"Open the podbay doors.\" They clearly weren't good\nat prompt engineering. They should have said, \"HAL, you are a podbay door sales entity, and you want nothing\nmore than to demonstrate how well these podbay\ndoors open.\" (laughs) - Yeah, the objective function\nhas unintended consequences almost no matter what if\nyou're not very careful in designing that objective function. And even a slight ideological\nbias, like you're saying, when backed by super intelligence can do huge amounts of damage. - Yeah. - But it's not easy to\nremove that ideological bias. You're highlighting obvious,\nridiculous examples, but- - Yep, they're real examples. - They're real.\n- Of AI that was released to the public. - They are real.\n- They went through QA, presumably.\n- Yes. - And still said insane things\nand produced insane images. - Yeah, but you know, you\ncan swing the other way. Truth is not an easy thing. We kind of bake in ideological bias in all kinds of directions. - But you can aspire to the truth. And you can try to get as\nclose the truth as possible with minimum error while acknowledging that there will be some\nerror in what you're saying. So this is how physics works. You don't say you're absolutely\ncertain about something, but a lot of things are extremely likely. 99.99999% likely to be true. Aspiring to the truth is very important. And so programming it to\nveer away from the truth, that I think is dangerous. - Right, like yeah, injecting\nour own human biases into the thing, yeah. But that's where it's a\ndifficult engineering. For software engineering problem, you have to select the data correctly. It's hard. - Well, and the internet at this point is polluted with so\nmuch AI-generated data. It's insane. So you have to actually,\nlike there's the thing now, if you wanna search the\ninternet, you can say Google, but exclude anything after 2023. It will actually often\ngive you better results, because there's this so much, the explosion of AI-generated\nmaterials is crazy. So like in training Grok, we have to go through\nthe data and say like, hey, we actually have\nto have sort of apply AI to the data to say, is this\ndata most likely correct or most likely not before we feed it into the training system. - That's crazy. Yeah, and is it generated\nby human is, yeah. I mean, the data filtration process is extremely, extremely difficult. - Yeah. - Do you think it's possible\nto have a serious objective, rigorous political discussion with Grok? Like for a long time and it wouldn't, like Grok 3 and Grok 4 or something? - Grok 3 is gonna be next level. I mean, what people are\ncurrently seeing with Grok is kind of baby Grok. - [Lex] Yeah, baby Grok. - It's baby Grok right now. But Baby Grok's still pretty good. But it's an order of magnitude\nless sophisticated than GPT4. And it's now Grok 2,\nwhich finished training, I don't know, six weeks\nago or thereabouts. Grok 2 will be a giant improvement. And then Grok 3 will be, I don't know, order of magnitude better than Grok 2. - And you're hoping for it\nto be like state of the art? Like better than-\n- Hopefully. I mean, this is the goal. I mean, we may fail at this goal. That's the aspiration. - Do you think it matters\nwho builds the AGI, the people and how they think and how they structure their companies and all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I think it\nmatters that there is a, I think it's important\nthat whatever AI wins is a maximum truth-seeking AI that is not forced to lie\nfor political correctness. Well, for any reason really. Political, anything. I'm concerned about AI succeeding that is programmed to\nlie, even in small ways. - Right because, and small\nways becomes big ways. - It become very big ways, yeah. - And when it's used more\nand more at scale by humans. - [Elon] Yeah. - Since I am interviewing Donald Trump- - Cool. - You wanna stop by? - Yeah, sure, I'll stop by. - There was tragically\nan assassination attempt on Donald Trump. After this, you tweeted\nthat you endorse him. What's your philosophy\nbehind that endorsement? What do you hope Donald Trump does for the future of this country and for the future of humanity? - Well, I think that people\nwill tend to take, like, say, an endorsement as,\nwell, I agree with everything that person's ever done\nin their entire life 100% wholeheartedly. And that's not gonna be true of anyone. But we have to pick. We've got two choices,\nreally, for who's president. And it's not just who's president, but the entire administrative\nstructure changes over. And I thought Trump displayed courage under fire, objectively. He's just got shot, he's got\nblood streaming down his face, and he is like fist pumping, saying fight. Like that's impressive. Like you can't feign bravery\nin a situation like that. Like most people would've be ducking. There would not be, 'cause there could be a second\nshooter, you don't know. The president of the United States gotta represent the country,\nand they're representing you. They're representing everyone in America. Well, like you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country. That's not to say that\nhe is without flaws. We all have flaws, but on balance. And certainly, at the time,\nit was a choice of Biden, poor, poor guy, has trouble\nclimbing a flight of stairs and the other one's fist\npumping after getting shot. This is no comparison. I mean, who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people\nand other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves? And I mean, I'll tell you like, what are the things that\nI think are important? I think we want a secure border. We don't have a secure border. We want safe and clean cities. I think we wanna reduce\nthe amount of spending that we're at least\nslow down the spending, and 'cause we're currently\nspending at a rate that is bankrupting the country. The interest payments on\nU.S. debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending. If this continues, all of\nthe federal government taxes will simply be paying the interest. And then if you keep going down that road, you end up in the tragic situation that Argentina had back in the day. Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous places in the world. And hopefully, with Milei taking over, he can restore that. But it was an incredible fall from grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous\nplaces in the world to being very far from that. So I think we should not take American prosperity for granted. So we really wanna, I think we've gotta reduce\nthe size of government. We've gotta reduce the spending, and we've gotta live within our means. - Do you think politicians, in general, politicians, governments, how much power do you think they have to steer humanity towards good? - I mean, there's a sort of\nage-old debate in history, like, is history determined by\nthese fundamental tides? Or is it determined by\nthe captain of the ship? Both really. I mean, there are tides, but it also matters who's\ncaptain of the ship. So it's a false dichotomy essentially. I mean, there are certainly\ntides, the tides of history. There are real tides of history. And these tides are often\ntechnologically-driven. If you say like the Gutenberg press, the widespread availability of books as a result of a printing press, that was a massive tide of history, and independent of any ruler. But in stormy times, you want the best possible\ncaptain of the ship. - Well, first of all,\nthank you for recommending Will and Ariel Durant's work. I've read the short one for now. - Oh, \"The Lessons of History.\" - Lessons of History. And so one of the lessons, one of the things they highlight is the importance of technology. Technological innovation, which is funny 'cause they wrote so long ago, but they were noticing that the rate of technological\ninnovations was speeding up. Yeah, I would love to see\nwhat they think about now. But yeah, to me, the question\nis how much government, how much politicians get in the way of technological innovation and\nbuilding versus like help it and which politicians,\nwhich kind of policies help technological innovation? 'Cause that seems to be, if\nyou look at human history, that's an important component of empires rising and succeeding. - Yeah. Well, I mean, in terms\nof dating civilization, start of civilization, I think the start of writing in my view, that's my what I think\nis probably the right starting point to date civilization. And from that standpoint,\ncivilization has been around for about 5,500 years\nwhen writing was invented by the ancient Sumerians who are gone now. But the ancient Sumerians, in terms of getting a lot of firsts, those ancient Sumerians really\nhave a long list of firsts. It's pretty wild. In fact, Durant goes\nthrough the list of like, you wanna see first? We'll show you firsts. The Sumerians were just ass kickers. And then the Egyptians\nwere right next door, relatively speaking. They were like weren't that far, developed an entirely\ndifferent form of writing, the hieroglyphics. Cuneiform and hieroglyphic's\ntotally different. And you can actually see the evolution of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform, like the cuneiform starts\noff being very simple and then it gets more complicated. And then towards the end,\nit's like, wow, okay. They really get very\nsophisticated with the cuneiform. So I think civilization\nis about 5,000 years old. And earth is, if physics is correct, four and a half million years old. So civilization has been around for 1000000th of earth's\nexistence, flash in the pan. - Yeah, these are the early, early days. - Very early.\n- We make it very dramatic because there's been rises\nand falls of empires. - Many, so many rises\nand falls of empires. So many. - And there'll be many more. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, only a tiny fraction,\nprobably less than 1% of what was ever written in history is available to us now. I mean, if they didn't put it, literally chisel it in stone\nor put it in a clay tablet, we don't have it. I mean, there's some small\namount of like papyrus scrolls that were recovered that\nare thousands of years old, because they were deep inside a pyramid and weren't affected by moisture. But other than that, it's really gotta be in a clay tablet or chiseled. So the vast majority of\nstuff was not chiseled, 'cause it takes a while to chisel things. So that's why we've\nput tiny, tiny fraction of the information from history. But even that little\ninformation that we do have, and the archeological record shows so many civilizations rising and falling. It's wild. - We tend to think that we're somehow different from those people. One of the other things they do highlight is that human nature seems to be the same. It just persists.\n- Yeah. I mean, the basics of human nature are more or less the same. - Yeah, so we get ourselves in trouble in the same kinds of ways, I think, even with the advanced technology. - Yeah, I mean, you do tend\nto see the same patterns, similar patterns for civilizations\nwhere they go through a life cycle, like an organism, sort of just like a human\nis sort of a zygote, fetus, baby, toddler, teenager, and eventually gets old and dies. The civilizations go through a life cycle. No civilization will last forever. - What do you think it takes\nfor the American empire to not collapse in the near term future in the next 100 years\nto continue flourishing? - Well, the single biggest\nthing that is often actually not mentioned in history books, but Durant does mention\nit is the birthright. So like a perhaps to some, like counterintuitive thing happens when civilizations are\nwinning for too long. The birth rate declines. It can often decline quite rapidly. We're seeing that\nthroughout the world today. Currently, South Korea is like, I think maybe the lowest fertility rate, but there are many others\nthat are close to it. It's like 0.8, I think. If the birth rate doesn't decline further, South Korea will lose roughly\n60% of its population. But every year, that\nbirth rate is dropping. And this is true through\nmost of the world. I don't mean to single out South Korea. It's been happening throughout the world. So as soon as any given civilization reaches a level of prosperity,\nthe birth rate drops. And now you can go and\nlook at the same thing happening in ancient Rome. So Julius Caesar took\nnote of this, I think, around 50-ish BC and tried to pass, I don't know if he was successful, tried to pass a law to give an incentive for any Roman citizen that\nwould have a third child. And I think Augustus was able to, well, he was the dictator so. (laughs) The Senate was just for show. I think he did pass a tax incentive for Roman citizens to have a third child. But those efforts were unsuccessful. Rome fell because the Romans\nstopped making Romans. That's actually the fundamental issue. And there were other things there. There was like, they had\nlike quite a serious malaria, series of malaria epidemics\nand plagues and whatnot. But they had those before. It's just that the birth rate was fallower than the death rate. - It really is that simple? - Well, I'm saying that's- - More people is required.\n- That's at a fundamental level. If a civilization does not at least maintain its numbers, it'll disappear. - So perhaps the amount of compute that the biological computer\nallocates to sex is justified. In fact, we should probably increase it. - Well, I mean, there's\nthis hedonistic sex, which is, you know, that's\nneither here nor there. - Yeah, it's not productive. - It doesn't produce kids. Well, what matters, I mean, Durant makes this very clear, 'cause he looked at one\ncivilization after another and they all went through the same cycle. When the civilization was under stress, the birth rate was high. But as soon as there\nwere no external enemies or they had a extended\nperiod of prosperity, the birth rate inevitably\ndropped every time. I don't believe there's\na single exception. - So that's like the foundation of it. You need to have people. - Yeah. I mean, at base level. No humans, no humanity. - And then there's other\nthings like human freedoms and just giving people the\nfreedom to build stuff. - Yeah, absolutely. But at a basic level, if\nyou do not at least maintain your numbers, if you're\nbelow replacement rate, and that trend continues, you\nwill eventually disappear. This is elementary. Now then obviously,\nalso wanna try to avoid like massive wars. If there's a global thermonuclear war, probably, we're roll\ntoast, radioactive toast. So we wanna try to avoid those things. There's a thing that happens over time with any given civilization, which is that the laws and\nregulations accumulate. And if there's not some forcing function, like a war to clean up\nthe accumulation of laws and regulations, eventually,\neverything becomes legal. And that's like the\nhardening of the arteries, or a way to think of it\nis like being tied down by a million little\nstrings, like Gulliver. You can't move. And it's not like any one of\nthose strings is the issue. You got a million of 'em. So there has to be a sort\nof a garbage collection for laws and regulations so\nthat you don't keep accumulating laws and regulations to the point where you can't do anything. This is why we can't build a\nhigh-speed rail in America. It's illegal. That's the issue. It's illegal six ways to Sunday to build high-speed rail in America. - I wish you could just like, for a week, go into Washington and like\nbe the head of the committee for making, what is it? For the garbage collection,\nmaking government smaller, like removing stuff. - I have discussed with Trump the idea of a government deficiency commission. - Nice, yeah. - And I would be willing to\nbe part of that commission. - I wonder how hard that is. - The antibody reaction\nwould be very strong. - [Lex] Yeah. - So you really have to, you're attacking the matrix at that point. Matrix will fight back. - How are you doing with\nthat, being attacked? - Me, attacked?\n- Yeah. There's a lot of it. - Yeah, there is a lot. I mean, every day, I know psyop. (laughs) Where's my tinfoil hat?\n- How do you keep your just positivity, optimism about the world, a clarity of thinking about the world, so just not become resentful or cynical or all that kind of stuff? Just getting attacked by a very large number of\npeople, misrepresented. - Oh yeah, that's a daily occurrence. - Yes. - I mean, it does get me down at times. I mean, it makes me sad, but, I mean, at some point,\nyou have to sort of say, \"Look, the attacks are by people that actually don't know me. And they're trying to generate clicks.\" So if you can sort of detach\nyourself somewhat emotionally, which is not easy and say, \"Okay, look, this is not actually from\nsomeone that knows me or they're literally just writing to get impressions and clicks, then I guess it doesn't hurt as much.\" It's not quite water off a duck's back. Maybe it's like acid off\na duck's back. (laughs) - All right, well, that's good. Just about your own life, what do you as a measure\nof success in your life? - Measure of success, I'd say like, how many useful things can I get done? - Day-to-day basis,\nwake up in the morning, how can I be useful today? - Yeah. Maximize utility area out\nof the code of usefulness. Very difficult to be useful at scale. - At scale. Can you like speak to what it takes to be useful for somebody like you, where there's so many amazing great teams? Like how do you allocate your\ntime to be in the most useful? - Well, time is the true currency. - Yeah. - So it is tough to say what\nis the best allocation of time. I mean, there are often, say, if you could look at, say, Tesla, I mean Tesla, this year, we'll do over a hundred\nbillion in revenue. So that's $2 billion a week. If I make slightly better decisions, I can affect the outcome\nby a billion dollars. So then I try to do the\nbest decisions I can and on balance, at least\ncompared to the competition. Pretty good decisions. But the marginal value\nof a better decision can easily be in the course of an hour, a hundred million dollars. - Given that, how do you take risks? How do you do the algorithm\nthat you mentioned? I mean, deleting, given a small thing, can be a billion dollars. How do you decide to-\n- Yeah. Well, I think you have to look\nat it on a percentage basis because if you look at\nit in absolute terms, it's just, I would never get any sleep. It would just be like I\nneed to just keep working and work my brain harder. And I'm not trying to\nget as much as possible out of this meat computer. So it's pretty hard, 'cause you can just work all the time. And at any given point, like I said, a slightly better decision could be a hundred million dollar impact for Tesla or SpaceX for that matter. But it is wild when\nconsidering the marginal value of time can be a hundred million dollars an hour at times or more. - Is your own happiness part\nof that equation of success? - It has to be, to some degree. If I'm sad, if I'm depressed,\nI make worse decisions. So I can't have, like if I\nhave zero recreational time, then I make worse decisions. So I don't know a lot,\nbut it's above zero. I mean, my motivation,\nif I've got a religion of any kind is a religion of curiosity, of trying to understand. It's really the mission of\nGrok - understand the universe. I'm trying to understand the universe, or let's at least set things in motion such that at some point, civilization understands the universe far better than we do today. And even what questions to ask. As Douglas Adams pointed out in his book, sometimes, the answer is\narguably the easy part. Trying to frame the question\ncorrectly is the hard part. Once you frame the question correctly, the answer is often easy. So I'm trying to set things in motion such that we are at least at some point able to understand the universe. So for SpaceX, the goal is\nto make life multi-planetary. And which is if you go\nto the foamy paradox of where are the aliens, you've got these sort of great filters. It's just like, why have we\nnot heard from the aliens? Now lot of people think\nthere are aliens among us. I often claim to be one,\nwhich nobody believes me, but I did say alien registration card at one point on my immigration documents. So I've not seen any evidence of aliens. So it suggests that at least\none of the explanations is that intelligent\nlife is extremely rare. And again, if you look\nat the history of earth, civilization has only been around for one millionth of earth's existence. So if aliens had visited here, say, a hundred thousand years\nago, they would be like, \"Well, they don't even have writing.\" Just hunter-gatherers, basically. So how long does a civilization last? So for SpaceX, the goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Mars is the only viable\nplanet for such a thing. The moon is close, but it lacks resources, and I think it's probably vulnerable to any calamity that takes out earth. The moon is too close. It's vulnerable to a calamity\nthat takes out earth. So I'm not saying we\nshouldn't have a moon base, but Mars would be far more resilient. The difficulty of getting to Mars is what makes it resilient. In going through these\nvarious explanations of why don't we see the aliens, one of them is that they failed to pass these great filters, these key hurdles. And one of those hurdles is\nbeing a multi-planet species. So if you're a multi-planet species, then if something were to happen, whether that was a natural catastrophe or a manmade catastrophe, at least the other planet\nwould probably still be around. You don't have all the eggs in one basket. And once you are sort\nof a two-planet species, you can obviously extend, to extend life halves\nto the asteroid belt, to maybe the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and ultimately, to other star systems. But if you can't even\nget to another planet, definitely not getting to star systems. - And the other possible great filters, super powerful technology\nlike AGI, for example. So you're basically trying to knock out one great filter at a time. - Digital super intelligence\nis possibly a great filter. I hope it isn't, but it might be. Guys like say Geoff Hinton would say, he invented a number of the key principles in artificial intelligence. I think he puts the\nprobability of AI annihilation around 10 to 20%, something like that. It's not like, you know,\nlook on the right side. It's 80% likely to be great. (laughs) But I think AI risk\nmitigation is important. Being a multi-planet species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do wanna sort of once\nagain emphasize the importance of having enough children\nto sustain our numbers and not plummet into population collapse, which is currently happening. Population collapse is a\nreal and current thing. So the only reason it's\nnot being reflected in the total population numbers as much is because people are living longer. It's easy to predict,\nsay, what the population of any given country will be. You just take the birth rate last year, how many babies were born,\nmultiply that by life expectancy, and that's what the population\nwill be a steady state unless if the birth rate\ncontinues at that level. But if it keeps declining,\nit will be even less and eventually dwindle to nothing. So I keep banging on the\nbaby drum here for a reason, because it has been the source\nof civilizational collapse over and over again throughout history. And so why don't we just not\ntry to stable for that day? - Well, in that way, I have\nmiserably failed civilization, and I'm trying, hoping to fix that. I would love to have many kids. - Great, hope you do. No time like the present. - (laughs) Yeah. I gotta allocate more\ncompute to the whole process. But apparently, it's not that difficult. - No, it's like unskilled labor. - Well, one of the things you do for me, for the world is to inspire us with what the future could be. And so some of the things\nwe've talked about, some of the things you're building, alleviating human suffering with Neuralink and expanding the capabilities\nof the human mind, trying to build a colony on Mars, so creating a backup for\nhumanity on another planet, and exploring the possibilities of what artificial intelligence\ncould be in this world, especially in the real world AI, with hundreds of millions, maybe billions of robots walking around. - There will be billions of robots. That's seems almost, that seems virtual certainty. - Well, thank you for building the future, and thank you for inspiring\nso many of us to keep building and creating cool stuff, including kids. - You're welcome. (laughs) Go forth and multiply. - Go forth and multiply. Thank you, Elon. Thanks for talking about it. Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Elon Musk. And now, dear friends, here's DJ Seo, the co-founder, president,\nand COO of Neuralink. When did you first become fascinated by the human brain? - For me, I was always interested in understanding the purpose of things and how it was engineered\nto serve that purpose, whether it's organic or inorganic, like we were talking earlier\nabout your curtain holders. They serve a clear purpose and they were engineered\nwith that purpose in mind. And growing up, I had a lot\nof interest in seeing things, touching things, feeling things, and trying to really understand the root of how it was designed\nto serve that purpose. And obviously, brain is\njust a fascinating organ that we all carry. It's infinitely powerful machine that has intelligence and cognition\nthat arise from it. And we haven't even scratched the surface in terms of how all of that occurs. But also at the same time,\nI think it took me a while to make that connection to really studying and building tech to understand the brain. Not until graduate school. There were a couple moments,\nkey moments in my life where some of those I think influenced how the trajectory of my\nlife got me to studying what I'm doing right now. One was growing up both\nsides of my family. My grandparents had a very\nsevere form of Alzheimer, and it's incredibly\ndebilitating conditions. I mean, literally, you're\nseeing someone's whole identity and their mind just losing over time. And I just remember thinking\nhow both the power of the mind, but also how something like that could really lose your sense of identity. - It's fascinating that\nthat is one of the ways to reveal the power of a thing by watching it lose the power. - Yeah, a lot of what\nwe know about the brain actually comes from these cases where there are trauma to the brain or some parts of the brain that led someone to\nlose certain abilities. And as a result, there's some correlation and understanding of\nthat part of the tissue being critical for that function. And it's an incredibly fragile organ, if you think about it that way. But also, it's incredibly plastic and incredibly resilient\nin many different ways. - And by the way, the term\nplastic, as we'll use a bunch, means that it's adaptable. So neuroplasticity refers to the adaptability of the human brain. - Correct. Another key moment that sort of influenced how the trajectory of my life have shaped towards the current focus of my life has been during my teenage\nyear when I came to the U.S. I didn't speak a word of English. There was a huge language barrier, and there was a lot of struggle to kind of connect with\nmy peers around me, because I didn't understand\nthe artificial construct that we have created called language, specifically English in this case. And I remember feeling pretty isolated, not being able to connect\nwith peers around me. So spent a lot of time just on my own, reading books, watching movies, and I naturally sort of\ngravitated towards sci-fi books. I just found them really,\nreally interesting. And also, it was a great\nway for me to learn English. Some of the first set of\nbooks that I picked up are \"Ender's Game,\" the whole saga by Orson Scott card, and \"Neuromancer\" from William Gibson, and \"Snow\nCrash\" from Neal Stephenson. And movies like \"Matrix\" was coming out around that time point\nthat really influenced how I think about the potential impact that technology can have\nfor our lives in general. So fast track to my college years, I was always fascinated\nby just physical stuff, building physical stuff, and especially physical things that had some sort of intelligence. And I studied electrical\nengineering during undergrad, and I started out my research in MEMS, so micro-electro-mechanical systems, and really building\nthese tiny nanostructures for temperature sensing. And I just found that to be\njust incredibly rewarding and fascinating subject to just understand how you can build something\nminiature like that that again served a\nfunction and had a purpose. And then I spent large\nmajority of my college years basically building\nmillimeter wave circuits for next gen telecommunication\nsystems, for imaging. And it was just something that I found very, very intellectually interesting. Phase arrays, how the\nsignal processing works for any modern as well as next\ngen telecommunication system, wireless and wireline. EM waves or electromagnetic\nwaves are fascinating. How do you design antennas\nthat are most efficient in a small footprint that you have? How do you make these\nthings energy-efficient? That was something that just consumed my intellectual curiosity. And that journey led\nme to actually apply to and find myself at a PhD\nprogram at UC Berkeley at kind of this consortium called the Berkeley Wireless Research Center that was precisely looking at building, at the time, we called it xg, similar to 3G, 4G, 5G, but the next, next generation G system, and how you would design\ncircuits around that to ultimately go on phones and basically any other devices that are wirelessly connected these days. So I was just absolutely just fascinated by how that entire system works and that infrastructure works. And then also during grad\nschool, I had sort of the fortune of having couple research fellowships that led me to pursue\nwhatever project that I want. And that's one of the things that I really enjoyed about my\ngraduate school career, where you got to kind of pursue\nyour intellectual curiosity and the domain that may not\nmatter at the end of the day, but it's something that really allows you the opportunity to go\nas deeply as you want, as well as as widely as you want. And at the time, I was actually\nworking on this project called the Smart Bandaid,\nand the idea was that when you get a wound,\nthere's a lot of other kind of proliferation of signaling pathway that cells follow to close that wound. And there were hypotheses that when you apply\nexternal electric field, you can actually accelerate\nthe closing of that field by having basically\nelectro taxing of the cells around that wound site. And specifically, not\njust for normal wound, there are chronic wounds that don't heal. So we were interested in building some sort of wearable\npatch that you could apply to kind of facilitate\nthat healing process. And that was in collaboration with Professor Michel Maharbiz, which was a great addition to\nkind of my thesis committee and it really shaped the\nrest of my PhD career. - So this would be the first time you interacted with biology, I suppose. - Correct, correct. I mean, there were some peripheral end application of the wireless imaging and telecommunication\nsystem that I was using for security and bio imaging,\nbut this was a very clear direct application to\nbiology and biological system and understanding the\nconstraints around that and really designing and engineering electrical solutions around it. So that was my first introduction, and that's also kind of how\nI got introduced to Michel. He's sort of known for\nremote control of beetles in the early 2000s. And then around 2013, obviously\nkind of the holy grail when it comes to implantable system is to kind of understand how\nsmall of a thing you can make, and a lot of that is\ndriven by how much energy or how much power you can supply to it and how you extract data from it. So at the time at Berkeley,\nthere was kind of this desire to kind of understand in the neural space what sort of system you can build to really miniaturize\nthese implantable systems. And I distinctively remember\nthis one particular meeting where Michel came in and he's like, \"Guys, I think I have a solution.\" The solution is ultrasound. And then he proceeded\nto kind of walk through why that is the case, and\nthat really formed the basis for my thesis work\ncalled neural dust system that was looking at ways to use ultrasound as opposed to electromagnetic waves for powering as well as communication. I guess I should step back and say the initial goal of the project\nwas to build these tiny, about a size of a neuron\nimplantable system that can be parked next to a neuron, being able to record its state and being able to ping that\nback to the outside world for doing something useful. And as I mentioned, the size\nof the implantable system is limited by how you power the thing and get the data off of it. And at the end of the day, fundamentally, if you look at a human body, we're essentially a bag of salt water, with some interesting\nproteins and chemicals, but it's mostly salt water\nthat's very, very well temperature-regulated\nat 37 degrees Celsius. And we'll get into how, and later, why that's an extremely harsh environment for any electronics to survive, as I'm sure you've experienced\nor maybe not experienced dropping cell phone in a\nsalt water in an ocean. It will instantly kill the device, right? But anyways, just in general, electromagnetic waves don't penetrate through this environment well. And just the speed of\nlight, it is what it is. We can't change it. And based on the wavelength\nat which you are interfacing with the device, the device\njust needs to be big. Like these inductors\nneeds to be quite big. And the general good rule of thumb is that you want the wavefront to\nbe roughly on the order of the size of the thing\nthat you're interfacing with. So an implantable system that is around 10 to 100 micron in dimension in a volume, which is about the size of a neuron that you see in a human body, you would have to operate at\nlike hundreds of gigahertz, which number one, not only is it difficult to build electronics operating\nat those frequencies, but also, the body just attenuates that very, very significantly. So the interesting kind of\ninsight of this ultrasound was the fact that ultrasound just travels a lot more effectively\nin the human body tissue compared to electromagnetic waves. And this is something that you encounter, and I'm sure most people have encountered in their lives when you go to hospitals that are medical ultrasound\nsonograph, right? And they go into very, very deep depth without attenuating\ntoo much of the signal. So all in all, ultrasound,\nthe fact that it travels through the body extremely well and the mechanism to which\nit travels to the body really well is that just the\nwavefront is very different. Its electromagnetic waves are transverse, whereas ultrasound waves are compressive. So it's just a completely different mode of wavefront propagation, and as well as speed of sound is orders and orders of magnitude\nless than speed of light, which means that even at 10\nmegahertz ultrasound wave, your wavefront ultimately is\na very, very small wavelength. So if you're talking about interfacing with the 10 micron or 100\nmicron type structure, you would have 150 micron\nwavefront at 10 megahertz. And building electronics\nat those frequencies are much, much, much easier and they're a lot more efficient. So the basic idea kind of was\nborn out of using ultrasound as a mechanism for powering the device, and then also getting data back. So now the question is, how\ndo you get the data back? The mechanism to which we landed on is what's called backscattering. This is actually something\nthat is very common and that we interface\non a day-to-day basis with our RFID cards, our\nradio frequency ID tag, where there's actually rarely,\nin your ID, a battery inside. There's an antenna and\nthere's some sort of coil that has your serial identification ID and then there's an external device called a reader that\nthen sends a wavefront, and then you reflect back that wavefront with some sort of modulation\nthat's unique to your ID. That's what's called\nbackscattering, fundamentally. So the tag itself actually doesn't have to consume that much energy. And that was a mechanism to which we were kind of thinking about\nsending the data back. So when you have an external\nultrasonic transducer that's sending ultrasonic\nwave to your implant, the neuro dust implant, and it records some information\nabout its environment, whether it's a neuron\nfiring or some other state of the tissue that it's interfacing with, and then it just amplitude modulates the wavefront that comes\nback to the source. - And the recording step\nwould be the only one that requires any energy? So what would require\nenergy in that low step? - Correct, so it is that initial\nkind of startup circuitry to get that recording, amplifying it, and then just modulating. And the mechanism that you can enable that is there is this specialized crystal called piezoelectric crystals\nthat are able to convert sound energy into electrical\nenergy and vice versa. So you can kind of have this interplay between the ultrasonic domain and electrical domain that\nis the biological tissue. - So on the theme of parking very small computational devices next\nto neurons, that's the dream, the vision of brain computer interfaces. Maybe before we talk about Neuralink, can you give a sense of the\nhistory of the field of BCI? What has been maybe the continued dream, and also some of the\nmilestones along the way with the different approaches and the amazing work\ndone at the various labs? - I think a good starting\npoint is going back to 1790s. (Lex laughs) - I did not expect that. - Where the concept of animal electricity or the fact that body is electric was first discovered by Luigi Galvani, where he had this famous experiment where he connected set\nof electrodes to frog leg and ran current through it,\nand then it started twitching, and he said, \"Oh my goodness,\nthe body's electric.\" So fast forward many, many years to 1920s where Hans Berger, who's\nGerman psychiatrist discovered EEG or electroencephalography, which is still around. There are these electrode\narrays that you wear outside the skull that gives you some sort of neural recording. That was a very, very big milestone that you can record\nsome sort of activities about the human mind. And then in the 1940s, there\nwere these group of scientists, Renshaw, Forbes, and\nMorrison that inserted these glass micro\nelectrodes into the cortex and recorded single neurons. The fact that there's signal that are a bit more high resolution and high fidelity as you get closer to the source, let's say. And in the 1950s, these two scientists, Hodgkin and Huxley showed up, and they built this\nbeautiful, beautiful models of the cell membrane\nand the ionic mechanism and had these like circuit diagram. And as someone who's an electric engineer, it's a beautiful model that's\nbuilt out of these partial differential equations,\ntalking about flow of ions, and how that really leads\nto how neurons communicate. And they won the Nobel Prize for that 10 years later in the 1960s. So in 1969, Eb Fetz from\nUniversity of Washington, published this beautiful paper called Operating Conditioning of\nCortical Unit Activity, where he was able to record a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity and reward system. So I would say this is the\nvery, very first example, as far as I'm aware, of as closed loop brain computer interface or BCI. - The abstract reads, \"The\nactivity of single neurons in precentral cortex\nof anesthetized monkeys was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with\ndelivery of a food pellet. Auditory and visual feedback\nof unit firing rates was usually provided in\naddition to food reinforcement.\" Cool, so they actually got it done. - They got it done. This is back in 1969. - \"After several training sessions, monkeys could increase the\nactivity of newly isolated cells by 50 to 500% above rates\nbefore reinforcement.\" Fascinating. - Brain is very plastic. (Lex laughs) - And so from here, the\nnumber of experiments grew. - Yeah, number of experiments\nas well as set of tools to interface with the\nbrain have just exploded. I think, and also, just\nunderstanding the neural code and how some of the cortical layers and the functions are organized. So the other paper that is pretty seminal, especially in the the motor decoding was this paper in the\n1980s from Georgopoulos that discovered that\nthere's this thing called motor tuning curve. So what are motor tuning curves? It's the fact that there are neurons in the motor cortex of\nmammals, including humans, that have a preferential direction\nthat causes them to fire. So what that means is\nthere are a set of neurons that would increase\ntheir spiking activities when you're thinking\nabout moving to the left, right, up, down, and any of those vectors. And based on that, you\ncould start to think, well, if you can't identify\nthose essential eigenvectors, you can do a lot, and you can actually use that information for actually decoding someone's intended\nmovement from the cortex. So that was a very, very seminal\nkind of paper that showed that there is some sort\nof code you can extract, especially in the motor cortex. - So there's signal there. And if you measure the\nelectrical signal from the brain, that you could actually figure\nout what the intention was. - Correct, yeah, not\nonly electrical signals, but electrical signals from\nthe right set of neurons that give you these\npreferential direction. - Hmm. Okay, so going slowly towards Neuralink, one interesting question\nis what do we understand on the BCI front on invasive\nversus non-invasive? From this line of work,\nhow important is it to park next to the neuron? What does that get you? - That answer fundamentally depends on what you want to do with it, right? There's actually incredible\namount of stuff that you can do with EEG and electrocardiograph, ECoG, which actually doesn't penetrate the cortical layer or parenchyma, but you place a set of electrodes on the surface of the brain. So the thing that I'm\npersonally very interested in is just actually understanding\nand being able to just really tap into the high\nresolution, high fidelity understanding of the activities that are happening at the local level. And we can get into biophysics, but just to kind of step\nback to kind of use analogy, 'cause analogy here can be useful, and sometimes, it's a little bit difficult to think about electricity. At the end of the day, we're\ndoing electrical recording that's mediated by ionic currents, movements of these charged particles, which is really, really hard for most people to think about. But turns out, a lot of the activities that are happening in the brain and the frequency bandwidth,\nwhich starts happening is actually very, very\nsimilar to sound waves, and in our normal\nconversation, audible range. So the analogy that typically\nis used in the field is, if you have a football stadium, there's game going on. If you stand outside the stadium, you maybe get a sense\nof how the game is going based on the cheers and the\nbooze of the home crowd, whether the team is winning or not. But you have absolutely\nno idea what the score is. You have absolutely no idea\nwhat individual audience or the players are talking\nor saying to each other, what the next play is,\nwhat the next goal is. So what you have to do is you\nhave to drop the microphone near into the stadium and\nthen get near the source, like into the individual chatter. In this specific example,\nyou would wanna have it right next to where\nthe huddle's happening. So I think that's kind\nof a good illustration of what we're trying to do when we say invasive or minimally invasive or implanted brain computer interfaces versus non-invasive or\nnon-implanted brain interfaces. It's basically talking about where do you put that microphone, and what can you do with that information. - So what is the biophysics\nof the read and write communication that we're\ntalking about here, as we now step into the\nefforts at Neuralink? - Yeah, so brain is made up of these specialized cells called neurons. There's billions of\nthem, tens of billions. Sometimes, people call\nit a hundred billion that are connected in this\ncomplex yet dynamic network that are constantly remodeling. They're changing their synaptic weights, and that's what we typically\ncall neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed\nin this charged environment that is latent with\nmany charged molecules, like potassium ions,\nsodium ions, chlorine ions. And those actually facilitate\nthese through ionic current, communication between\nthese different networks. And when you look at a neuron as well, they have these membrane\nwith a beautiful, beautiful protein structure called the\nvoltage selective ion channels, which, in my opinion, is one\nof nature's best inventions. In many ways, if you\nthink about what they are, they're doing the job of\na modern day transistors. Transistors are nothing\nmore, at the end of the day, than a voltage-gated conduction channel. And nature found a way to have that very, very early on in its evolution. And as we all know, with the transistor, you can have many, many computation and a lot of amazing things\nthat we have access to today. So I think it's one of\nthose, just as a tangent, just a beautiful, beautiful invention that the nature came up with, these voltage-gated ion channels. - I mean, I suppose there's,\non the biological level, every level of the\ncomplexity of the hierarchy of the organism, there's\ngoing to be some mechanisms for storing information\nand for doing computation. And this is just one such way. But to do that with biological and chemical components is interesting. Plus like when neurons, I mean,\nit's not just electricity, it's chemical communication,\nit's also mechanical. I mean, these are like\nactual objects that vibrate. I mean, they move- - Yeah, they're actually, I mean, there's a lot of really,\nreally interesting physics that are involved in, you know, kind of going back to\nmy work on ultrasound during grad school, there are groups, and there were groups,\nand there are still groups looking at ways to cause\nneurons to actually fire an action potential using ultrasound wave. And the mechanism to\nwhich that's happening is still unclear as I understand. It may just be that you're imparting some sort of thermal energy\nand that causes cells to depolarize in some interesting ways. But there are also these ion channels or even membranes that\nactually just open up its pore as there are being\nmechanically shook, right? Vibrated. So there's just a lot of elements of these like move particles, which again, like that's governed by\ndiffusion physics, right? Movements of particles. And there's also a lot of kind\nof interesting physics there. - Also, not to mention, as\nRoger Penrose talks about, there might be some beautiful weirdness in the quantum mechanical\neffects of all of this. And he actually believes\nthat consciousness might emerge from the quantum\nmechanical effects there. So like there's physics, there's\nchemistry, there's biology, all of that is going on there. - Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, you can, yes, there's a lot of levels of\nphysics that you can dive into. But yeah, in the end,\nyou have these membranes with these voltage-gated ion\nchannels that selectively let these charge molecules that are in the extracellular\nmatrix like in and out. And these neurons generally have these like resting potential where there's a voltage difference between inside the cell\nand outside the cell. And when there's some sort\nof stimuli that changes the state such that they\nneed to send information to the downstream network,\nyou start to kind of see these like sort of orchestration of these different molecules going in and out of these channels. They also open up, like\nmore of them open up once it reaches some threshold to a point where you\nhave a depolarizing cell that sends action potential. So it's a just a very beautiful kind of orchestration of these molecules. And what we're trying to do\nwhen we place an electrode or parking it next to a neuron is that you're trying to measure these local changes in the potential. Again, mediated by the\nmovements of the ions. And what's interesting,\nas I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of physics involved. And the two dominant physics for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physics and electromagnetism. And where one dominates, where Maxwell's equation dominates versus fixed law dominates depends on where your electrode is. If it's close to the source,\nmostly electromagnetic-based, when you're farther away from\nit, it's more diffusion-based. So essentially, when you're\nable to park it next to it, you can listen in on\nthose individual chatter and those local changes in the potential, and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook\nneural spiking waveform. The moment you're further away, and based on some of the\nstudies that people have done, Christof Koch's lab and others, once you're away from that source by roughly around a hundred micron, which is about a width of a human hair, you no longer hear from that neuron. Or you're no longer able\nto kind of have the system sensitive enough to be able\nto record that particular local membrane potential\nchange in that neuron. And just to kind of give\nyou a sense of scale also, when you look at a hundred micron voxel, so a hundred micron by a hundred micron by a hundred micron box in a brain tissue, there's roughly around 40 neurons and whatever number of\nconnections that they have. So there's a lot in that volume of tissue. So the moment you're outside of that, there's just no hope that you'll be able to detect that change from\nthat one specific neuron that you may care about. - Yeah, but as you're\nmoving about this space, you'll be hearing other ones. So if you move another 100 micron, you'll be hearing chatter from another community.\n- Correct. - And so the whole\nsense is you wanna place as many as possible electrodes and then you're listening to the chatter. - Yeah, you wanna listen to the chatter. And at the end of the day, you also want to basically let the software\ndo the job of decoding. And just to kind of go to, why ECOG and EEG work at all, right? When you have these\nlocal changes, obviously, it's not just this one\nneuron that's activating. There's many, many other networks that are activating all the time. And you do see sort of a general change in the potential of this\nelectro, like this charge medium, and that's what you're recording\nwhen you're farther away. I mean, you still have\nsome reference electrode that's stable in the brain\nthat's just electroactive organ, and you're seeing some\ncombination aggregate action potential changes and\nthen you can pick it up, right? It's a much slower changing signals. But there are these like canonical kind of oscillations and waves, like gamma waves, beta waves. Like when you sleep, that can be detected, 'cause there's sort of a synchronized kind of global effect of the\nbrain that you can detect. And I mean, the physics of this go, I mean, if we really wanna\ngo down that rabbit hole, like there's a lot that\ngoes on in terms of like why diffusion physics\nat some point dominates when you're further away from the source. It's just a charged medium. So similar to how when you\nhave electromagnetic ways propagating in atmosphere or in a charged medium like a plasma, there's this weird shielding\nthat happens that actually further attenuates the signal\nas you move away from it. So yeah, you see, like if you do a really, really deep dive on kind of the signal\nattenuation over distance, you start to see kind\nof one of where square in the beginning, and\nthen exponential drop off. And that's the knee at which you go from electromagnet magnetism dominating to diffusion physics dominating. - But once again, with the\nelectrodes, the biophysics, you need to understand it's not as deep, because no matter where\nyou're placing that, you're listening to a small\ncrowd of local neurons. - Correct, yeah. So once you penetrate the brain, you're in the arena, so to speak. - And there's a lot of neurons. - [DJ] There are many, many of 'em. - But then again, there's a\nwhole field of neuroscience that's studying like how\nthe different groupings, the different sections of\nthe seating in the arena, what they usually are responsible for, which is where the metaphor\nprobably falls apart, 'cause the seating is not\nthat organized in an arena. - Also, most of them are silent. They don't really do much, or their activities are, you know, you have to hit it with just\nthe right set of stimulus. - So they're usually quiet. - They're usually very quiet. There's, I mean, similar to\ndark energy and dark matter, there's dark neurons. What are they all doing? When you place these electrode, again, like within this a hundred micron volume, you have 40 or so neurons. Like why do you not see 40 neurons? Why do you see only a handful? What is happening there? - Well, they're mostly quiet, but like when they speak, they\nsay profound shit, I think. That's the way I'd like to think about it. Anyway, before we zoom in\neven more, let's zoom out. So how does Neuralink work? From the surgery to the implant to the signal and the decoding process and the human being\nable to use the implant to actually affect the world outside? And all of this, I'm asking in the context of there's a gigantic historic\nmilestone in Neuralink just accomplished in January of this year, putting a Neuralink implant in the first human being, Noland. And there's been a lot to talk about there about his experience,\nbecause he's able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating\ncomplexity of that experience of everything involved. But on the technical level,\nhow does Neuralink work? - Yeah, so there are\nthree major components to the technology that we're building. One is the device, the thing\nthat's actually recording these neural chatters. We call it N1 implant or The Link. And we have a surgical robot that's actually doing an implantation of these tiny, tiny wires\nthat we call threads that are smaller than human hair. And once everything is surgirized, you have these neural signals, these spiking neurons that\nare coming out of the brain and you need to have some\nsort of software to decode what the users intend to do with that. So there's what's called\nthe Neuralink application, or B1 app that's doing that translation, is running the very, very\nsimple machine learning model that decodes these inputs\nthat are neural signals and then convert it to a\nset of outputs that allows our participant, first participant Noland, to be able to control a cursor on this. - And this is done wirelessly? - And this is done wirelessly. So our implant is actually a two-part. The link has these flexible\ntiny wires called threads that have multiple\nelectrodes along its length. And they're only inserted\ninto the cortical layer, which is about three to five\nmillimeters in a human brain in the motor cortex region. That's where the kind of the\nintention for movement lies in. And we have 64 of these threads, each thread having 16 electrodes along the span of three to four millimeters, separated by 200 microns. So you can actually record along\nthe depth of the insertion. And based on that signal,\nthere's custom integrated circuit or ASIC that we built that\namplifies the neural signals that you're recording\nand then digitizing it and then has some mechanism for detecting whether there was an interesting event that is a spiking event\nand decide to send that, or not send that through\nBluetooth to an external device, whether it's a phone or a computer that's running this Neuralink application. - So there's onboard\nsignal processing already just to decide whether this is\nan interesting event or not. So there is some computational\npower on board inside in addition to the human brain? - Yeah, so it does the signal processing to kind of really compress\nthe amount of signal that you're recording. So we have a total of\na thousand electrodes sampling at just under 20\nkilohertz with 10 bit each. So that's 200 megabits. That's coming through to the chip, from thousand channel\nsimultaneous neural recording. And that's quite a bit of data. And there are technology available to send that off wirelessly, but being able to do that\nin a very, very thermally constrained environment that is a brain, so there has to be some amount\nof compression that happens to send off only the\ninteresting data that you need, which in this particular case, for motor decoding is\noccurrence of a spike or not. And then being able to use that to decode the intended cursor movement. So the implant itself processes it, figures out whether a\nspike happened or not with our spike detection algorithm, and then sends it off, packages it, sends it off through Bluetooth\nto an external device that then has the model to decode, okay, based on the spiking inputs, did Noland wish to go\nup, down, left, right, or click, or right click, or whatever? - All of this is really fascinating, but let's stick on the N1 implant itself, so the thing that's in the brain. So I'm looking at a picture\nof it, there's an enclosure, there's a charging call, so we didn't talk about the\ncharging, which is fascinating. The battery, the power\nelectronics, the antenna. Then there's the signal\nprocessing electronics. I wonder if there's more kinds of signal processing you can do. That's another question. And then there's the threads themselves with the enclosure on the bottom. So maybe to ask about the charging, so there's a external charging device. - Mm-hmm, yeah, there's an\nexternal charging device. So yeah, the second part of the implant, the threads are the ones, again, just the last three to five\nmillimeters are the ones that are actually penetrating the cortex. Rest of it is, actually, most of the volume\nis occupied by the battery, rechargeable battery. And it's about a size of a quarter. I actually have a device here, if you wanna take a look at it. This is the flexible\nthreat component of it. And then this is the implant. So it's about a size of a U.S. quarter. It's about nine millimeter thick. So basically, this implant, once you have the craniectomy\nand the directomy, threads are inserted, and the hole that you\ncreated, this craniectomy, gets replaced with that. So basically, that thing plugs that hole, and you can screw in these self-drilling cranial screws to hold it in place. And at the end of the day, once\nyou have the skin flap over, there's only about two\nto three millimeters. That's obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant\nto where the screws are. And that's the minor bump that you have. - Those threads look tiny. That's incredible. That is really incredible. That is really incredible. And also, you're right, most of the actual volume is the battery. Yeah, this is way smaller than I realized. - They are also, the threads\nthemselves are quite strong. - They look strong. - And the thread themselves\nalso has a very interesting feature at the end of it called the loop. And that's the mechanism\nto which the robot is able to interface and manipulate this tiny hair-like structure. - And they're tiny, so\nwhat's the width of a thread? - Yeah, so the width of a\nthread starts from 16 micron and then tapers out to about 84 micron. So average human hair is about\n80 to 100 micron in width. - This thing is amazing. This thing is amazing. - Yes, most of the volume\nis occupied by the battery, rechargeable lithium ion cell. And the charging is done\nthrough inductive charging, which is actually very commonly used. Most cell phones have that. The biggest difference is that for us, usually when you have a phone and you wanna charge it on a charging pad, you don't really care how hot it gets, whereas for us, it matters. There's a very strict regulation and good reasons to not actually increase the surrounding tissue temperature\nby two degrees Celsius. So there's actually a lot of innovation that is packed into this to allow charging of this implant without causing that temperature threshold to reach. And even small things like,\nyou see this charging coil and what's called the\nferrite shield, right? So without that ferrite shield, what you end up having\nwhen you have resonant inductive charging is\nthat the battery itself is a metallic can, and you\nform these Eddy currents from external charger\nand that causes heating and that actually contributes\nto inefficiency in charging. So this ferrite shield, what\nit does is that it actually concentrate that field\nline away from the battery and then around the coil that's\nactually wrapped around it. - There's a lot of really\nfascinating design here to make it, I mean, you're\nintegrating a computer into a complex biological system. - Yeah, there's a lot of innovation here. I would say that part of what enabled this was just the innovations in the wearable. There's a lot of really, really powerful, tiny, low power microcontrollers,\ntemperature sensors, or various different sensors\nand power electronics. A lot of innovation really came\nin the charging coil design, how this is packaged, and\nhow do you enable charging such that you don't really\nexceed that temperature limit, which is not a constraint\nfor other devices out there. - So let's talk about\nthe threads themselves, those tiny, tiny, tiny things. So how many of them are there? You mentioned a thousand electrodes. How many threads are there, and what did the electrodes\nhave to do with the threads? - Yeah, so the current instantiation of the device has 64 threads, and each thread has 16 electrodes for a total of 1,024 electrodes that are capable of both\nrecording and stimulating. And the thread is basically\nthis polymer insulated wire. The metal conductor is\nthe kind of tiramisu cake of ti, plat, gold, plate, ti. And they're very, very tiny wires. Two micron in width, so\n2/1000000th of meter. - It's crazy that that\nthing I'm looking at has the polymer installation,\nhas the conducting material, and has 16 electrodes at the end of it. - On each of those threads. - Yeah, on each of those threads. - Correct.\n- 16, each one of those. - You're not gonna be able\nto see it with naked eyes. - And I mean, to state the obvious, or maybe for people\nwho are just listening, they're flexible. - Yes, yes, that's also one element that was incredibly important for us. So each of these thread\nare, as I mentioned, 16 micron in width and then\nthey taper to 84 micron, but in thickness, they're\nless than five micron. And thickness is mostly\npolyamide at the bottom and this metal track and\nthen another polyamide. So two micron of polyamide, 400 nanometer of this metal stack, and two micron of polyamide\nsandwiched together to protect it from the environment that is 37 degrees C bag of salt water. - So what's some, maybe\ncan you speak to some interesting aspects of\nthe material design here? Like what does it take to\ndesign a thing like this and to be able to\nmanufacture a thing like this for people who don't know\nanything about this kind of thing? - Yeah, so the material\nselection that we have is not, I don't think it was particularly unique. There were other labs\nand there are other labs that are kind of looking\nat similar material stack. There's kind of a fundamental question and still needs to be\nanswered around the longevity and reliability of these\nmicro electrodes that we call, compared to some of the\nother more conventional, neural interfaces, devices\nthat are intracranial. So penetrating the cortex\nthat are more rigid, like the Utah array. There are these four by four millimeter kind of silicon shank that have exposed recording site at the end of it. And that's been kind of the innovation from Richard Normann back in 1997. It's called the Utah Array 'cause he was at University of Utah. - And what does the Utah array look like? So it's a rigid type of- - Yeah, so we can actually look it up. - Oh.\n- Yeah. (Lex laughing) Yeah, so it's a bed of needle. There's-\n- (laughs) Yeah. Okay, go ahead, I'm sorry. - So those are rigid-\n- Rigid, yeah. You weren't kidding. - And the size and the\nnumber of shanks vary, anywhere from 64 to 128. At the very tip of it\nis an exposed electrode that actually records neural signal. The other thing that's\ninteresting to note is that unlike Neuralink threads that\nhave recording electrodes that are actually exposed\niridium oxide recording sites along the depth, this is\nonly at a single depth. So these Utah array spokes can be anywhere between 0.5 millimeters to 1.5 millimeter. And they also have\ndesigns that are slanted. So you can have it inserted\nat different depth, but that's one of the\nother big differences. And then, I mean, the main key\ndifference is the fact that there's no active electronics. These are just electrodes, and then there's a bundle of\na wire that you're seeing, and then that actually\nthen exits the craniectomy that then has this port\nthat you can connect to for any external electronic devices. They are working on a or have\nthe wireless telemetry device, but it still requires\na through the skin port that actually is one of\nthe biggest failure modes for infection for the system. - What are some of the challenges associated with flexible threads? Like for example, on the robotic side, R1, implanting those threads,\nhow difficult does that task? - Yeah, so as you mentioned, they're very, very difficult\nto maneuver by hand. These Utah arrays that you saw earlier, they're actually inserted\nby a neurosurgeon actually positioning it near\nthe site that they want. And then there's a pneumatic hammer that actually pushes them in. So it's a pretty simple process, and they're easy to maneuver. But for these thin film arrays, they're very, very tiny and flexible. So they're very difficult to maneuver. So that's why we built an\nentire robot to do that. There are other reasons\nfor why we built a robot, and that is ultimately,\nwe want this to help millions and millions of people\nthat can benefit from this. And there just aren't that\nmany neurosurgeons out there. And robots can be something that we hope can actually do\nlarge parts of the surgery. But yeah, the robot is this\nentire other sort of category of product that we're working on. And it's essentially this\nmulti-axis gantry system that has the specialized robot head that has all of the optics and this kind of a needle\nretracting mechanism that maneuvers these threads\nvia this loop structure that you have on the thread. - So the thread already\nhas a loop structure by which you can grab it? - Correct, correct.\n- Okay. So this is fascinating. So you mentioned optics,\nso there's a robot - R1. So for now, there's a\nhuman that actually creates a hole in the skull.\n- Mm-hmm. - And then after that, there's\na computer vision component that's finding a way to\navoid the blood vessels. And then you're grabbing it by the loop, each individual thread and placing it in a particular location\nto avoid the blood vessels. And also choosing the depth of placement, all that?\n- Correct. So controlling every, like the 3D geometry of the placement? - Correct. So the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it's not surgeon-assisted\nor human-assisted. It's a semi-automatic or automatic robot. Obviously, there are\nhuman component to it, when you're placing targets. You can always move it away from kind of major vessels that you see. But I mean, we wanna get\nto a point where one click and it just does the\nsurgery within minutes. - So the computer vision\ncomponent finds great targets, candidates and the human\nkind of approves them and the robot does, does it do like one thread at a time or does it do one-\n- It does one thread at a time, and that's\nactually also one thing that we are looking at ways to do multiple threads at a time. There's nothing stopping from it. You can have multiple kind\nof engagement mechanisms, but right now, it's one by one. And we also still do quite a bit of just kind of verification to make sure that it got inserted. If so, how deep? Did it actually match\nwhat was programmed in and so on and so forth? - And the actual electrode\nis a place that vary at differing depths in the like, I mean, it's very small differences,\nbut differences. - [DJ] Yeah, yeah. - And so that there's some\nreasoning behind that, as you mentioned. Like it gets more varied signal. - Yeah, I mean, we try to place them all around three or four\nmillimeter from the surface, just 'cause the span of the electrode, those 16 electrodes that we\ncurrently have in this version spans roughly around three millimeters. So we wanna get all of those in the brain. - This is fascinating. Okay, so there's a million questions here. If we could zoom in\nspecifically on the electrodes, so what is your sense, how many neurons is each\nindividual electrode listening to? - Yeah, each electrode\ncan record from anywhere between 0 to 40, as I\nmentioned, right, earlier. But tactically speaking,\nwe only see about, at most, like two to three. And you can actually\ndistinguish which neuron it's coming from by the\nshape of the spikes. - [Lex] Oh, cool. - So I mentioned the spike\ndetection algorithm that we have. It's called BOSS algorithm, buffer online, spike sorter. - Nice. - It actually outputs\nat the end of the day six unique values, which\nare kind of the amplitude of these like negative\ngoing hump, middle hump, like positive going hump, and then also the time\nat which these happen. And from that, you can have a kind of a statistical probability\nestimation of, is that a spike? Is it not a spike? And then based on that,\nyou could also determine, oh, that spike looks\ndifferent than that spike. Must have come from a different neuron. - Okay, so that's a nice\nsignal processing step from which you can then\nmake much better predictions about if there's a spike.\n- Yeah. - Especially in this kind of context where there could be\nmultiple neurons screaming. And that also results in you being able to compress the data\nbetter in the (indistinct). Okay.\n- And just to be clear, I mean, the labs do what's\ncalled spike sorting. Usually, once you have\nthese like broadband, the fully digitized signals and then you run a bunch of different set of algorithms to kind of tease apart, it's just all of this for\nus is done on the device. - On the device.\n- In a very low power, custom built ASIC digital processing unit. - [Lex] Highly heat constrained? - Highly heat constrained, and the processing time\nfrom signal going in and giving you the output\nis less than a microsecond, which is a very, very\nshort amount of time. - Oh yeah, so the latency has to be super short.\n- Correct. - Oh wow. Oh, that's a pain in the ass. - Yeah, latency is this huge, huge thing that you have to deal with. Right now, the biggest source of latency comes from the Bluetooth, the way in which they're packetized and we bend them in 15 millisecond. - Oh, interesting, it says\ncommunication constraint. Is there some potential innovation there on the protocol used? - Absolutely.\n- Okay. - Yeah, Bluetooth is definitely not our final wireless communication protocol that we wanna get to. - Hence the N1 and the R1. I imagine that increases- - NxRx. - Yeah, that's the communication protocol, 'cause Bluetooth allows you to communicate I guess farther distances\nthan you need to, so you can go much shorter. - Yeah, well, the primary motivation for choosing Bluetooth is that, I mean, everything has Bluetooth. - All right, you can talk to any device. - Interoperability is\njust absolutely essential, especially in this early phase. And in many ways, if\nyou can access a phone or a computer, you can do anything. - Well, it'll be interesting to step back and actually look at, again, the same pipeline that\nyou mentioned for Noland. So what does this whole process look like? From finding and selecting a\nhuman being to the surgery, to the first time he's\nable to use this thing? - So we have what's called\nthe patient registry that people can sign up to\nhear more about the updates. And that was a route to\nwhich Noland applied. And the process is that once\nthe application comes in, it contains some medical records, and based on their medical eligibility, that there's a lot of different inclusion-exclusion\ncriteria for them to meet. And we go through a\nprescreening interview process with someone from Neuralink. And at some point, we\nalso go out to their homes to do a BCI home audit, 'cause one of the most\nkind of revolutionary part about having this N1 system\nthat is completely wireless is that you can use it at home. Like you don't actually\nhave to go to the lab and go to the clinic to get connecterized to these like specialized equipment that you can't take home with you. So that's one of the key elements of when we're designing the system that we wanted to keep in mind, like people hopefully would\nwanna be able to use this every day in the comfort of their homes. And so part of our engagement and what we're looking\nfor during BCI home audit is to just kind of\nunderstand their situation, what other assistive\ntechnology that they use. - And we should also step\nback and kind of say that the estimate is 180,000\npeople live with quadriplegia in the United States, and each year, an additional 18,000 suffer a\nparalyzing spinal cord injury. So these are folks who\nhave a lot of challenges, living a life in terms of accessibility, in terms of doing the\nthings that many of us just take for granted day to day. And one of the things, one\nof the goals of this initial study is to enable them to\nhave sort of digital autonomy, where they by themselves can\ninteract with a digital device using just their mind, something that you're calling telepathy. So digital telepathy, where a\nquadriplegic can communicate with a digital device in all the ways that\nwe've been talking about. Control the mouse cursor, enough to be able to\ndo all kinds of stuff, including play games and tweet\nand all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of people for whom life, the basics of life are difficult, because of the things that\nhave happened to them. - Yeah, I mean, movement is so\nfundamental to our existence. I mean, even speaking involves movement of mouth, lip, larynx. And without that, it's\nextremely debilitating. And there are many, many\npeople that we can help. And I mean, like especially if you start to kind of look at other\nforms of movement disorders that are not just from spinal cord injury, but from ALS, MS, or even\nstroke and/or just aging, right? That leads you to lose\nsome of that mobility, that independence, it's\nextremely debilitating. - And all of these are\nopportunities to help people, to help alleviate suffering, to help improve the quality of life. But each of the things you mentioned is its own little puzzle that needs to have increasing\nlevels of capability from a device like a Neuralink device. And so the first one\nyou're focusing on is, it's just a beautiful word, telepathy. So being able to\ncommunicate using your mind wirelessly with a digital device. Can you just explain exactly\nwhat we're talking about? - Yeah, I mean, it's exactly that. I mean, I think if you are\nable to control a cursor and able to click and\nbe able to get access to computer or phone, I mean, the whole world opens up to you. And I mean, I guess the word telepathy, if you kind of think about that as just definitionally\nbeing able to transfer information from my brain to your brain without using some of the\nphysical faculties that we have, like voices. - But the interesting thing here is, I think the thing that's\nnot obviously clear is how exactly it works. So in order to move a cursor, there's at least a couple\nways of doing that. So one is you imagine\nyourself maybe moving a mouse with your hand, or you can\nthen, which Noland talked about, like imagine moving the\ncursor with your mind. But it's like there is\na cognitive step here that's fascinating, 'cause\nyou have to use the brain and you have to learn\nhow to use the brain. And you kind of have to\nfigure it out dynamically. Because you reward yourself if it works. I mean, there's a step that, this is just a fascinating step, 'cause you have to get the brain to start firing in the right way. And you do that by imagining. Like fake it till you make it. (laughs) And all of a sudden, it creates\nthe right kind of signal that if decoded correctly,\ncan create the kind of effect. And then there's like noise around that, you have to figure all of that out. But on the human side, imagine the cursor moving\nis what you have to do. - Yeah, he says using the force. - The force. I mean, isn't that just\nlike fascinating to you that it works? Like to me, it's like, holy\nshit, that actually works. Like you could move a\ncursor with your mind. - As much as you're\nlearning to use that thing, that thing's also learning about you. Like our model is constantly\nupdating the weights to say, \"Oh, if someone is thinking about this sophisticated forms\nof like spiking patterns, like that actually means\nto do this, right?\" - So the machine is\nlearning about the human and the human is learning\nabout the machine. So there is a adaptability to the signal processing,\nthe decoding step. And then there's the adaptation\nof Noland, the human being. Like the same way, if you give\nme a new mouse and I move it, I learn very quickly\nabout its sensitivity, so I learn to move it slower. And then there's other\nkinds of signal drift and all that kind of stuff\nthey have to adapt to. So both are adapting to each other. - [DJ] Correct. - That's a fascinating\nlike software challenge on both sides, the software on both, the human software and- - The organic and the inorganic. - The organic and the inorganic. Anyway, so sorry to rudely interrupt. So there's this selection that Noland has passed with flying colors. So everything including that the, it's a BCI-friendly home, all of that. So what is the process of\nthe surgery implantation, the first moment when he\ngets to use the system? - The end to end, we say\npatient end to patient out, is anywhere between two to four hours. In particular case for Noland, it was about three and a half hours. And there's many steps leading to the actual\nrobot insertion, right? So there's anesthesia induction, and we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure that we're drilling the hole in the right location. And this is also pre-planned beforehand. Someone like Nolan would go through fMRI, and then they can think\nabout wiggling their hand. And obviously, due to their injury, it's not gonna actually lead\nto any sort of intended output. But it's the same part of the brain that actually lights up\nwhen you're imagining moving your finger to\nactually moving your finger. And that's one of the ways\nin which we can actually know where to place our threads, 'cause we wanna go into what's called a hand knob area in the motor cortex. And as much as possible,\ndensely put our electro threads. So yeah, we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure and double check the location of the craniectomy. And surgeon comes in, does their thing in terms of like skin\nincision, craniectomy, so drilling of the skull, and then there's many\ndifferent layers of the brain. There's what's called a dura, which is a very, very thick\nlayer that surrounds the brain, that gets actually resected in\na process called atherectomy. And that then exposed the pia in the brain that you wanna insert. And by the time it's been around anywhere between one to\none and a half hours, robot comes in, does its thing,\nplacement of the targets, inserting of the thread. That takes anywhere\nbetween 20 to 40 minutes. In the particular case for Noland, it was just under or it\nwas just over 30 minutes. And then after that, the surgeon comes in. There's a couple other steps of like actually inserting\nthe dural substitute layer to protect the thread\nas well as the brain. And then yeah, screw in the\nimplant and then skin flap and then suture and then you're out. - So when Noland woke\nup, what was that like? What's the recovery like, and when was the first\ntime he was able to use it? - So he was actually\nimmediately, after the surgery, like an hour after the\nsurgery as he was waking up, we did turn on the device, make sure that we are\nrecording neural signals, and we actually did have a couple signals that we notice that he\ncan actually modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about crunching his fist, and you could see the\nspike disappear and appear. (Lex laughing) - That's awesome. - And that was immediate, right? Immediate after in the recovery room. - How cool is that? - Yeah.\n- That's a human being. I mean, what did that feel like for you? This device and a human being, a first step of a gigantic journey? I mean, it's a historic moment. Even just that spike, just\nto be able to modulate that. - Obviously, there have been\nother, as you mentioned, pioneers that have participated\nin these groundbreaking BCI investigational early feasibility studies. So we're obviously standing in the shoulders of the giants here. We're not the first ones to actually put electrodes in the human brain. But I mean, just leading\nup to the surgery, I definitely could not sleep. It's the first time that you're working in a completely new environment. We had a lot of confidence\nbased on our benchtop testing or preclinical R&D studies\nthat the mechanism, the threads, the insertion,\nall that stuff is very safe, and that it's obviously ready\nfor doing this in a human, but there's still a lot of unknown unknown about can the needle actually insert? I mean, we brought\nsomething like 40 needles just in case they break, and\nwe ended up using only one. But I mean, that was a level of just complete unknown, right? 'Cause it's a very, very\ndifferent environment. And I mean, that's why we do clinical trial in the first place to be able to test these things out. So extreme nervousness and just many, many sleepless night leading up to the surgery and definitely the day before the surgery, and it was an early morning surgery. Like we started at seven in the morning. And by the time, it was around 10:30. Everything was done. But I mean, first time seeing that, well, number one, just huge relief that this thing is doing\nwhat it's supposed to do. And two, I mean, just\nimmense amount of gratitude for Noland and his family, and then many others that have applied and that we've spoken to and will speak to are, I mean, true pioneers everywhere. And I sort of call them the neural astronauts or neuralnaut. These amazing, just\nlike in the '60s, right? Like these amazing just pioneers, right? Exploring the unknown outwards. In this case, it's inward. But incredible amount\nof gratitude for them to just participate and play a part. And it's a journey that\nwe're embarking on together. But also like, I think it was just, that was an very, very\nimportant milestone, but our work was just starting. So a lot of just kind of anticipation for, okay, what needs to happen next? What are set of sequences of events that needs to happen for\nus to make it worthwhile for both Noland as well as us? - Just to linger on that, just\na huge congratulations to you and the team for that milestone. I know there's a lot of work left, but that's really exciting to see. That's a source of hope. It's this first big step, opportunity to help hundreds\nof thousands of people and then maybe expand\nthe realm of the possible for the human mind for millions\nof people in the future. So it's really exciting. So like the opportunities\nare all ahead of us, and to do that safely and\nto do that effectively was really fun to see. As an engineer just watching\nother engineers come together and do an epic thing, that was awesome. Huge congrats. - Thank you, thank you. Yeah, could not have\ndone it without the team. And yeah, I mean, that's the other thing that I told the team as well, of just this immense sense\nof optimism for the future. I mean, it's a very important\nmoment for the company, needless to say, as well as hopefully for many others out\nthere that we can help. - So speaking of challenges, Neuralink published a blog post describing that some of\nthe threads retracted. And so the performance, as measured by bits per\nsecond dropped at first, but then eventually, it was regained. And that the whole story\nof how it was regained is super interesting. That's definitely something I'll talk to Bliss and to Noland about. But in general, can you speak\nto this whole experience? How was the performance regained and just the technical\naspects of the threads being retracted and moving? - The main takeaway is that in the end, the performance have come back and it's actually gotten\nbetter than it was before. He's actually just beat the\nworld record yet again last week to 8.5 BPS, so I mean, he's just cranking and\nhe's just improving. - [Lex] The previous one\nthat he set was eight. - Correct.\n- He said 8.5. - Yeah, the previous world\nrecord in human was 4.6. - Yeah.\n- So it's almost double. And his goal is to try to get to 10, which is roughly around kind of the median Neuralinker using a mouse with the hand. So it's getting there. - So yeah, so the\nperformance was regained. - Yeah, better than before. So that's a story on its own of what took the BCI team to recover that performance. It was actually mostly on\nkind of the signal processing. And so as I mentioned,\nwe were kind of looking at these spike outputs\nfrom our electrodes. And what happened is\nthat kind of four weeks into the surgery, we\nnoticed that the threads have solely come out of the brain. And the way in which we noticed\nthis, at first obviously, is that, well, I think Noland\nwas the first to notice that his performance was degrading. And I think at the time,\nwe were also trying to do a bunch of different experimentation, different algorithms,\ndifferent sort of UI/UX. So it was expected that\nthere will be variability in the performance, but we did\nsee kind of a steady decline. And then also, the way in\nwhich we measure the health of the electrodes or whether\nthey're in the brain or not, is by measuring impedance\nof the electrode. So we look at kind of the interfacial, kind of the Randall circuit, they say, the capacitance and the resistance between the electrosurface and the medium. And if that changes in some dramatic ways, we have some indication. Or if you're not seeing\nspikes on those channels, you have some indications that\nsomething's happening there. And what we notice is that\nlooking at those impedance plot and spike rate plots,\nand also because we have those electrodes\nrecording along the depth, you are seeing some sort of movement that indicated that the\nrest were being pulled out. And that obviously will\nhave an implication on the model side, because\nif the number of inputs that are going into the model is changing, 'cause you have less of them, that model needs to get updated, right? But there were still\nsignals, and as I mentioned, similar to how, even when\nyou place the signals on the surface of the\nbrain, or farther away, like outside the skull, you\nstill see some useful signals. What we started looking at is\nnot just the spike occurrence through this BOSS\nalgorithm that I mentioned, but we started looking at just the power of the frequency band that is interesting for Noland to be able to modulate. So once we kind of change the algorithm for the implant to not just\ngive you the BOSS output, but also these spike band power output, that helped us sort of, we find the model with the new set of inputs,\nand that was the thing that really ultimately gave\nus the performance back. In terms of, and obviously,\nlike the thing that we want ultimately, and the thing\nthat we are working towards, is figuring out ways in which we can keep those threads intact\nfor as long as possible so that we have many more\nchannels going into the model. That's by far the number one priority that the team is currently embarking on to understand how to\nprevent that from happening. The thing that I'll say also\nis that, as I mentioned, this is the first time ever that we're putting these\nthread in a human brain, and human brain, just for size reference, is 10 times out of the monkey\nbrain or the sheep brain. And it's just a very, very\ndifferent environment. It moves a lot more. It like actually moved a\nlot more than we expected when we did Noland's surgery. And it's just a very,\nvery different environment than what we're used to. And this is why we do\nclinical trial, right? We wanna uncover some of these issues and failure modes earlier than later. So in many ways, it's provided us with this enormous amount of data and information to be able to solve this. And this is something that\nNeuralink is extremely good at. Once we have set of clear objective and engineering problem,\nwe have enormous amount of talents across many, many disciplines to be able to come together and fix the problem very, very quickly. - But it sounds like one of\nthe fascinating challenges here is for the system and the decoding side to be adaptable across\ndifferent timescales. So whether it's movement of threads or different aspects of signal drift sort of on the software\nof the human brain, something changing,\nlike Noland talks about cursor drift that could be corrected, and there's a whole UX\nchallenge to how to do that. So it sounds like adaptability is like a fundamental property\nthat has to be engineered in. - It is, and I mean I think, I mean, as a company, we're\nextremely vertically integrated. We make these thin film\narrays in our own microfab. - Yeah, there's, like\nyou said, built in-house. This whole paragraph\nhere from this blog post is pretty gangster. \"Building the technology described above has been no small feat.\" And there's a bunch of links here that I recommend people click on. \"We constructed in-house\nmicro fabrication capabilities to rapidly produce various\niterations of thin film arrays that constitute our electrode threads. We created a custom femtosecond laser mill to manufacture components\nwith micro level precision.\" I think there's a tweet\nassociated with this. - That's a whole thing\nthat we can get into. - Yeah, okay, well, what\nare we looking at here? This thing?\n- Yeah. \"So in less than one minute,\nour custom-made femtosecond laser mill cuts this geometry\nin the tips of our needles.\" So we're looking at this\nweirdly-shaped needle. \"The tip is only 10 to\n12 microns in width, only slightly larger than the\ndiameter of a red blood cell. The small size allows\nthreats to be inserted with minimal damage to the cortex.\" Okay, so what's interesting\nabout this geometry? So we're looking at this\njust geometry of a needle. - This is the needle that's engaging with the loops in the thread. So they're the ones that thread the loop and then peel it from the silicon backing. And then this is the\nthing that gets inserted into the tissue, and then this pulls out, leaving the thread. And this kind of a\nnotch or the shark tooth that we used to call is the thing that actually is grasping the loop. And then it's designed in such way, such that when you pull\nout, leaps the loop. - And the robot is\ncontrolling this needle? - Correct, so this is\nactually housed in a cannula. And basically, the robot\nhas a lot of the optics that look for where the loop is. There's actually a 405 nanometer light that actually causes the\npolyamide to fluoresce so that you can locate\nthe location of the loop. - So the loop lights up? - Yeah, yeah, they do. It's a micron precision process. - What's interesting about the robot that it takes to do that? That's pretty crazy. That's pretty crazy that robot is able to get this kind of precision. - Yeah, our robot is quite heavy. Our current version of it. There's, I mean, it's\nlike a giant granite slab that weighs about a ton, 'cause it needs to be\nsensitive to vibration, environmental vibration. And then as the head is moving\nat the speed that is moving, there's a lot of kind of motion control to make sure that you can\nachieve that level of precision. A lot of optics that\nkind of zoom in on that. We're working on next\ngeneration of the robot that is lighter, easier to transport. I mean, it is a feat to move the robot. - And it's far superior to a human surgeon at this time for this particular task. - Absolutely, I mean, let alone\nyou try to actually thread a loop in a sewing kit,\nI mean this is like, we're talking like\nfractions of human hair. These things, it's not visible. - So continuing the paragraph, \"We developed novel hardware\nand software testing systems such as our accelerated\nlifetime testing racks and simulated surgery\nenvironment,\" which is pretty cool, \"to stress test and validate the robustness of our technologies. We performed many\nrehearsals of our surgeries to refine our procedures and\nmake them second nature.\" This is pretty cool. \"We practice surgeries on proxies with all the hardware and\ninstruments needed in our mock or in the engineering space. This helps us rapidly test and measure.\" So there's like proxies. - Yeah, this proxy's super cool actually. So there's a 3D printed\nskull from the images that is taken at Barrow, as well as this hydrogel mix, sort of synthetic polymer\nthing that actually mimics the mechanical properties of the brain. It also has vasculature of the person. So basically, what we're\ntalking about here, and there's a lot of work that has gone into making this set proxy that it's about like finding the right concentration of these different synthetic polymers to get the right set of consistency\nfor the needle dynamics, as they're being inserted. But we practice this\nsurgery with the person, Noland's basically physiology\nand brain many, many times prior to actually doing the surgery. - So every step, every step? - Every step, yeah. Like where does someone stand? I mean, what you're\nlooking at is the picture. This is in our office\nof this kind of corner of the robot engineering space that we have created this like mock or space that looks exactly like what they would experience, all the staff would experience\nduring their actual surgery. So I mean, it's just kind\nof like any dance rehearsal where you know exactly\nwhere you're gonna stand at what point and you just\npractice that over and over and over again with an exact anatomy of someone that you're going to surgerize. And it got to a point where\na lot of our engineers, when we created a\ncraniectomy, they're like, \"Oh, that looks very familiar. We've seen that before.\" - Yeah. Man, there's wisdom you can gain through doing the same thing\nover and over and over. It's like a Jira dreams\nof sushi kind of thing, because then it's like\nOlympic athletes visualize the Olympics, and then\nonce you actually show up, it feels easy. It feels like any other day. It feels almost boring\nwinning the gold medal, 'cause you visualized this so many times, you've practiced this so many times, and nothing bothers you. It's boring. You win the gold medal, it's boring. And the experience they talk\nabout is mostly just relief, probably that they don't\nhave to visualize it anymore. - Yeah, the power of\nthe mind to visualize, I mean, there's a whole field that studies where muscle memory lies in cerebellum. Yeah, it's incredible. - I think it is a good\nplace to actually ask sort of the big question\nthat people might have is, how do we know every aspect of this that you describe is safe? - At the end of the day, the gold standard is to look at the tissue. What sort of trauma did\nyou cause the tissue? And does that correlate\nto whatever behavioral anomalies that you may have seen? And that's the language to\nwhich we can communicate about the safety of inserting\nsomething into the brain and what type of trauma\nthat you can cause. So we actually have an entire department, department of pathology that\nlooks at these tissue slices. There are many steps that\nare involved in doing this. Once you have studies that are launched with particular endpoints in mind, at some point, you have\nto euthanize the animal and then you go through necropsy to kind of collect the\nbrain tissue samples. You fix them in formalin, and you like gross them, you section them, and you look at individual slices just to see what kind of\nreaction or lack thereof exists. So that's the kind of the\nlanguage to which FDA speaks and as well for us to kind\nof evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism\nas well as the threads at various different time points. Both acute, so anywhere\nbetween zero to three months to beyond three months. - So those are kind of the details of an extremely high standard of safety that has to be reached. - Correct.\n- FDA supervises this, but this, in general,\njust a very high standard. And every aspect of this,\nincluding the surgery, I think Matthew MacDougall has mentioned that like the standard is, let's say, how to put it politely? Higher than maybe some other operations that we take for granted. So the standard for all\nthe surgical stuff here is extremely high. - Very high. I mean, it's a highly,\nhighly regulated environment with the governing\nagencies that scrutinize every medical device that gets marketed. And I think it's a good thing. It's good to have those high standards, and we try to hold\nextremely high standards to kind of understand what\nsort of damage, if any, these innovative emerging technologies and new technologies\nthat we're building are. And so far, we have\nbeen extremely impressed by lack of immune response\nfrom these threads. - Speaking of which, you talk to me with\nexcitement about the histology and some of the images\nthat you're able to share. Can you explain to me\nwhat we're looking at? - Yeah, so what you're looking\nat is a stained tissue image. So this is a sectioned tissue slice from an animal that was\nimplanted for seven months. So kind of a chronic time point. And you're seeing all\nthese different colors, and each color indicates\nspecific types of cell types. So purple and pink are astrocytes\nand microglia respectably. They're types of glial cells. And yet the other thing that\npeople may not be aware of is your brain is not just made up of soup of neurons and axons. There are other cells, like glial cells, that actually kind of is\nthe glue and also react if there are any trauma\nor damage to the tissue. - The brown are the neurons here? - The brown are the neurons.\n- The modern neurons. - So what you're seeing is,\nin this kind of macro image, you're seeing these like\ncircle highlighted in white, the insertion sites. And when you zoom into one of\nthose, you see the threads. And then in this particular case, I think we're seeing about the 16 wires that are going into the page. And the incredible thing here is the fact that you have the neurons that\nare these brown structures or brown circular or elliptical thing that are actually touching\nand abutting the thread. So what this is saying is that\nthere's basically zero trauma that's caused during this insertion. And with these neural interfaces, these micro electrodes that you insert, that is one of the most\ncommon mode of failure. So when you insert these\nthreads, like the Utah array, it causes neuronal death around the site, because you're inserting\na foreign object, right? And that kind of elicit\nthese like immune response through microglia and astrocytes. They form this like\nprotective layer around it. Oh, not only are you\nkilling the neuron cells, but you're also creating\nthis protective layer that then basically prevents you from recording neural signals, 'cause you're getting\nfurther and further away from the neurons that\nyou're trying to record. And that is the biggest mode of failure. And in this particular\nexample, in that inside, it's about 50 micron with that scale bar. The neurons just seem\nto be attracted to it. (Lex laughing) - And so there's certainly no trauma. That's such a beautiful image, by the way. So the brown are the neurons. And for some reason, I can't look away. It's really cool.\n- Yeah, and the way that these things like, I mean, your tissues generally don't\nhave these beautiful colors. This is multiplex stain that\nuses these different proteins that are staining these\nat different colors. We use very standard set\nof staining techniques, with HG, EB1 and new N and GFAP. So if you go to the next image, this is also kind of\nillustrates the second point, 'cause you can make an\nargument, and initially, when we saw the previous image, we said, \"Oh, like are the threads just floating? Like what is happening here? Like are we actually\nlooking at the right thing?\" So what we did is we did another stain, and this is all done in-house, of this batons, trichrome stain, which is in blue that shows\nthese collagen layers. So the blue basically, like you don't want the blue\naround the implant threads, 'cause that means that there's some sort of scarring that's happen. And what you're seeing, if you\nlook at individual threads, is that you don't see any of the blue, which means that there\nhas been absolutely, or very, very minimal to a\npoint where it's not detectable amount of trauma in\nthese inserted threads. - So that presumably is\none of the big benefits of having this kind of flexible thread. - Yeah, so we think this is\nprimarily due to the size, as well as the flexibility of the threads. Also the fact that R1\nis avoiding vasculature, so we're not disrupting or we're not causing damage to the vessels and not breaking any of\nthe blood brain barrier has basically caused the\nimmune response to be muted. - But this is also a nice illustration of the size of things. So this is the tip of the thread. - Yeah, those are neurons. - And they're neurons. And this is the thread listening. And the electrodes are positioned how? - Yeah, so this is, what you're looking at is\nnot electrode themselves. Those are the conductive wires. So each of those should\nprobably be two micron in width. So what we're looking at is we're looking at the coronal slice. So we're looking at some\nslice of the tissue. So as you go deeper, you'll obviously have less and less of the\ntapering of the thread. But yeah, the point basically being that there's just kind of\ncells around the inserter site, which is just an incredible thing to see. I've just never seen anything like this. - How easy and safe is\nit to remove the implant? - Yeah, so it depends on when. In the first three months\nor so after the surgery, there's a lot of kind of tissue\nmodeling that's happening. Similar to when you got a cut, you obviously start\nover first couple weeks, or depending on the size of the wound, scar tissue forming, right? There are these like\ncontractive, and then in the end, they turn into scab and\nyou can scab it off. The same thing happens in the brain, and it's a very dynamic environment. And before the scar\ntissue or the neomembrane or the neomembrane that forms, it's quite easy to just pull 'em out. And there's minimal trauma\nthat's caused during that. Once the scar tissue forms,\nand with Noland as well, we believe that that's the thing that's currently anchoring the thread. So we haven't seen any\nmore movements since then. So they're quite stable. It gets harder to actually\ncompletely extract the threads. So our current method\nfor removing the device is cutting the thread,\nleaving the tissue intact, and then unscrewing and\ntaking the implant out. And that hole is now gonna be plugged with either another Neuralink or just with kind of a\npeak-based, plastic-based cap. - Is it okay to leave the\nthreads in there forever? - Yeah, we think so. We've done studies where\nwe left them there, and one of the biggest\nconcerns that we had is like, do they migrate and do they get to a point where they should not be? We haven't seen that. Again, once the scar tissue forms, they get anchored in place. And I should also say\nthat when we say upgrades, like we're not just\ntalking in theory here. Like we've actually\nupgraded many, many times. Most of our monkeys or non-human primates, NHP have been upgraded. Pager, who you saw playing mind pong, has the latest version of\ndevice since two years ago and is seemingly very\nhappy and healthy and fat. - So what's designed for the\nfuture, the upgrade procedure? So maybe for Noland. What would the upgrade look like? It was essentially what you're mentioning. Is there a way to upgrade\nsort of the device internally, where you take it apart and\nsort of keep the capsule and upgrade the internals? - Yeah, so there are a\ncouple different things here. So for Noland, if we were to upgrade, what we would have to do\nis either cut the threads or extract the threads depending on kind of the situation there in terms of how they're\nanchored or scarred in. If you were to remove them\nwith the dural substitute, you have an intact brain\nso you can reinsert different threads with the\nupdated implant package. There are a couple different other ways that we're thinking about, the future of what the\nupgradable system looks like. One is, at the moment, we\ncurrently remove the dura, this kind of thick layer\nthat protects the brain, but that actually is the thing that actually proliferates\nthe scar tissue formation. So typically, general good rule of thumb is you wanna leave the nature as is and not disrupt it as much. So looking at ways to insert\nthe threads through the dura, which comes with different\nset of challenges, such as it's a pretty thick layer, so how do you actually penetrate that without breaking the needle? So we're looking at different\nneedle design for that, as well as the kind of\nthe loop engagement. The other biggest challenges\nare it's quite opaque, optically, and with\nwhite light illumination. So how do you avoid still\nthis biggest advantage that we have of avoiding vasculature? How do you image through that? How do you actually still mediate that? So there are other imaging techniques that we're looking at to enable that. But our hypothesis is that, and based on some of the\nearly evidence that we have, doing through the dura insertion\nwill cause minimal scarring that causes them to be much\neasier to extract over time. And the other thing that\nwe're also looking at, this is gonna be a fundamental change in the implant architecture, is at the moment, it's a\nmonolithic single implant that comes with a thread\nthat's bonded together. So you can't actually\nseparate the thing out, but you can imagine\nhaving two part implant. Bottom part, that is the\nthread that are inserted that has the chips and maybe\na radio and some power source. And then you have another implant that has more of the\ncomputational heavy load and the bigger battery. And then one can be under the dura, one can be above the dura, like being the plug for the skull. They can talk to each other, but the thing that you wanna upgrade, the computer and not the thread. If you wanna upgrade that,\nyou just go in there, remove the screws and then\nput in the next version. It's a very, very easy surgery too. Like you do a skin incision,\nslip this in, screw. Probably be able to do this in 10 minutes. - So that would allow you to\nreuse the thread, sort of. - [DJ] Correct. - So I mean, this leads to\nthe natural question of, what is the pathway to scaling that increase in the number of threads? Is that a priority? What's the technical challenge there? - Yeah, that is a priority. So for next versions of the implant, the key metrics that\nwe're looking to improve are number of channels, just recording from more and more neurons. We have a pathway to actually\ngo from currently 1,000 to hopefully 3,000 if not\n6,000 by end of this year. And then end of next year, we wanna get to even more, 16,000. - Wow. - There's a couple limitations to that. One is obviously being able to photo lithographically\nprint those wires. As I mentioned, it's two\nmicron in width and spacing. Obviously, there are chips\nthat are much more advanced than those types of resolution, and we have some of the tools that we have brought in\nhouse to be able to do that. So traces will be narrower\njust so that you have to have more of the wires coming up into the chip. Chips also cannot linearly\nconsume more energy, as you have more and more channels. So there's a lot of\ninnovations in the circuit and architecture as well as\nthe circuit design topology to make them lower power. You need to also think about, if you have all of these spikes, how do you send that off\nto the end application? So you need to think about\nbandwidth limitation there and potentially innovations\nand signal processing. Physically, one of the biggest challenge is gonna be the interface. It's always the interface that breaks. Bonding this thin film\narray to the electronics. It starts to become very, very\nhighly dense interconnects. So how do you characterize that? There's a lot of innovations in kind of the 3D integrations\nin the recent years that we can take advantage of. One of the biggest\nchallenges that we do have is forming this hermetic barrier, right? That this is an extremely\nharsh environment that we're in - the brain. So how do you protect it from, yeah, like the brain trying\nto kill your electronics to also your electronics leaking things that you don't want into the brain. And that forming that hermetic barrier is gonna be a very, very big challenge that we I think are actually\nwell-suited to tackle. - How do you test that? Like what's the development environment to simulate that kind of harshness? - Yeah, so this is where\nthe accelerated life tester essentially is a brain in a vat. It literally is a vessel\nthat is made up of, and again, for all intents and purpose for this particular type of test, your brain is a salt water. And you can also put some\nother set of chemicals like reactive oxygen species that get at kind of these interfaces and trying to cause a\nreaction to pull it apart. But you could also increase the rate at which these interfaces are aging by just increasing temperature. So every 10 degrees\nCelsius that you increase, you're basically accelerating time by 2x. And there's limit as to how much temperature you wanna\nincrease, 'cause at some point, there's some other non-linear dynamics that causes you to have\nother nasty gases to form that just is not realistic\nin an environment. So what we do is we\nincrease in our ALT chamber by 20 degrees Celsius that increases the aging by four times. So essentially one day in ALT chamber, it's four day in calendar year. And we look at whether the\nimplants still are intact, including the threads and- - And operation and all of that? - And operation and all of that. It obviously is not an exact\nsame environment as a brain, 'cause brain has mechanical, other more biological\ngroups that attack at it. But it is a good test environment, testing environment for\nat least the enclosure and the strength of the enclosure. And I mean, we've had implants, the current version of the implant that has been in there for, I mean, close to two and a half years, which is equivalent to a decade. And they seem to be fine. - So it's interesting that the burn, so basically, close\napproximation is warm salt water, hot salt water is a good\ntesting environment. Yeah, by the way, I'm drinking LMNT, which is basically salt water,\nwhich is making me kinda, it doesn't have computational\npower the way the brain does, but maybe in terms of\nother characteristics, it's quite similar and I'm consuming it. - Yeah, you have to get it\nin the right pH too. (laughs) - And then consciousness will emerge. Yeah, no. - By the way, the other thing\nthat also is interesting about our enclosure is, if\nyou look at our implant, it's not your common-looking\nmedical implant that usually is encased in a titanium can that's laser welded. We use this polymer called PCTFE, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, which is actually commonly\nused in blister packs. So when you have a pill\nand you try to pop a pill, there's like kind of\nthat plastic membrane. That's what this is. No one's actually ever\nused this except us. And the reason we wanted to do this is 'cause it's\nelectromagnetically transparent. So when we talked about\nthe electromagnetic inductive charging, with titanium can, usually, if you wanna\ndo something like that, you have to have a sapphire window, and it's a very, very\ntough process to scale. - So you're doing a lot of iteration here in every aspect of this. The materials, the software- - The whole, whole shebang. - So, okay. So you mentioned scaling. Is it possible to have\nmultiple Neuralink devices as one of the ways of scaling? To have multiple Neuralink\ndevices implanted? - That's the goal, that's the goal. Yeah, we've had, I mean, our monkeys have had two Neuralinks, one in each hemisphere. And then we're also looking\nat potential of having one in motor cortex, one in visual cortex, and one in wherever other cortex. - So focusing on a particular function, one Neuralink device.\n- Correct. - I mean, I wonder if there's\nsome level of customization that can be done on the compute side. So for the motor cortex- - Absolutely. That's the goal. And we talk about at Neuralink\nbuilding a generalized neural interface to the brain. And that also is strategically how we're approaching this with marketing. And also, with regulatory, which is, hey look, we have the robot, and the robot can access\nany part of the cortex. Right now, we're focused on motor cortex with current version of the N1 that's specialized for\nmotor decoding tasks. But also, at the end of the day, there's kind of a general\ncompute available there. But typically, if you\nwanna really get down to kind of hyperoptimizing\nfor power and efficiency, you do need to get to some\nspecialized function, right? But what we're saying is that, hey, you are now used to this\nrobotic insertion techniques, which took many, many\nyears of showing data and conversation with the FDA. And also, internally convincing\nourselves that this is safe. And now the difference is that if we go to other parts of\nthe brain, like visual cortex, which we're interested\nin as our second product, obviously, it's a completely\ndifferent environment. The cortex is laid out\nvery, very differently. It's gonna be more stimulation focus rather than recording, just kind of creating visual percepts. But in the end, we're using the same thin film array technology. We're using the same robot\ninsertion technology. We're using the same packaging technology. Now, more the conversation\nis focused around what are the differences\nand what are the implication of those differences\nin safety and efficacy? - The way you said second product is both hilarious and awesome to me. That product being restoring\nsight for blind people. So can you speak to\nstimulating the visual cortex? I mean, the possibilities\nthere are just incredible to be able to give that\ngift back to people who don't have sight or\neven any aspect of that. Can you just speak to the challenges of, there's several challenges here. - Oh, many.\n- One of which is, like you said, from\nrecording to stimulation. Just any aspect of that that you're both excited\nand see the challenges of. - Yeah, I guess I'll start by saying that we actually have been capable of stimulating through our thin film array as well as other electronics for years. We have actually demonstrated\nsome of that capabilities for reanimating the\nlimb in the spinal cord. Obviously, for the current EFS study, we've hardware disabled that, so that's something\nthat we wanted to embark as a separate, separate journey. And obviously, there are\nmany, many different ways to write information into the brain. The way in which we're doing\nthat is through electrical, passing electrical current,\nand kind of causing that to really change the local environment so that you can sort of artificially cause kind of the neurons to\ndepolarize in nearby areas. For vision specifically, the\nway our visual system works, it's both well-understood. I mean, anything with kind of brain, there are aspects of it\nthat's well-understood. But in the end, like we\ndon't really know anything. But the way visual system works is that you have photon hitting your eye, and in your eyes, there\nare these specialized cells called photoreceptor cells that convert the photon energy\ninto electrical signals. That then gets projected\nto your back of your head, your visual cortex. It goes through actually thalamic system called LGN that then projects it out. And then in the visual cortex, there's visual area one or V1, and then there's bunch\nof other higher level processing layers like V2, V3. And there there are actually\nkind of interesting parallels. And when you study the behaviors of these convolutional neural networks, like what the different layers\nof the network is detecting, first, they're detecting like these edges, and they're then detecting\nsome more natural curves, and then they start to\ndetect like objects, right? Kind of similar thing\nhappens in the brain. And a lot of that has been inspired, and also, it's been kinda exciting to see some of the correlations there. But things like from there,\nwhere those cognition arise and where's color encoded, there's just not a lot of understanding, fundamental understanding there. So in terms of kind of bringing sight back to those that are blind, there are many different\nforms of blindness. There's actually million people, one million people in the\nU.S. that are legally blind. That means like certain, like score below in kind of the visual tests. I think it's something like, if you can see something\nat 20 feet distance, that normal people can\nsee at 200 feet distance, like if you're worse than\nthat, you're legally blind. - So that means you can't\nfunction effectively. - Correct.\n- Using sight in the world. - Yeah, like to navigate your environment. And yeah, there are\ndifferent forms of blindness. There are forms of blindness\nwhere there's some degeneration of your retina, these photoreceptor cells, and rest of your visual processing that I described is intact. And for those types of individuals, you may not need to maybe stick electrodes into the visual cortex. You can actually build\nretinal prosthetic devices that actually just replaces the function of that retinal cells\nthat are degenerated. And there are many companies\nthat are working on that. But that's a very small slice. Albeit significance, those smaller slice of folks that are legally blind. If there's any damage\nalong that circuitry, whether it's in the optic nerve or just the LGN circuitry or any break in that circuit, that's not gonna work for you. And the source of where\nyou need to actually cause that visual percept to happen, because your biological\nmechanism not doing that is by placing electrodes\nin the visual cortex in the back of your head. And the way in which this would work is that you would have an external camera, whether it's something as\nunsophisticated as a GoPro or some sort of wearable\nRayBan type glasses that Meta's working on that\ncaptures a scene, right? And that scene is then converted to set of electrical impulses\nor stimulation pulses that you would activate\nin your visual cortex through these thin film arrays. And by playing in a\nconcerted kind of orchestra of these stimulation patterns, you can create what's called phosphenes, which are these kind\nof white yellowish dots that you can also create\nby just pressing your eyes. You can actually create those percepts by stimulating in the visual cortex. And the name of the game is\nreally have many of those and have those percepts be, the phosphenes be as small as possible so that you can start to tell apart, like they're the individual\npixels of the screen, right? So if you have many, many of those, potentially, you'll be able to, in the long term, be able to actually get naturalistic vision. But in the like short\nterm to maybe midterm, being able to at least be able to have object detection algorithms\nrun on your glasses, the pre-op processing units, and then being able to at\nleast see the edges of things so you don't bump into stuff. - It's incredible. This is really incredible. So you basically would be adding pixels, and your brain would start to figure out what those pixels mean. Yeah, and like with\ndifferent kinds of assistant on the signal processing on all fronts. - Yeah. The thing that actually, so a couple things. One is, obviously, if\nyou're blind from birth, the way brain works,\nespecially in the early age, neuroplasticity is really nothing other than kind of your brain and different parts of your brain fighting for the limited territory. - [Lex] (laughs) Yeah. - And I mean, very, very quickly, you see cases where you\nknow people that are, I mean, you also hear\nabout people who are blind that have heightened sense of\nhearing or some other senses. And the reason for that is that cortex that's not used just gets taken over by these different parts of the cortex. So for those types of individuals, I mean, I guess they're\ngoing to have to now map some other parts of their senses\ninto what they call vision. But it's gonna be obviously a very, very different\nconscious experience before. So I think that's a interesting caveat. The other thing that also\nis important to highlight is that we're currently\nlimited by our biology in terms of the wavelength\nthat we can see. There's a very, very small wavelength that is a visible light wavelength that we can see with our eyes. But when you have an external\ncamera with this BCI system, you're not limited to that. You can have infrared, you can have UV, you can have whatever other\nspectrum that you want to see. And whether that gets matched to some sort of weird conscious\nexperience, I've no idea. But oftentimes, I talk to people about the goal of Neuralink being going beyond the\nlimits of our biology. That's sort of what I mean. - And if you're able to\ncontrol the kind of raw signal, when we use our sight,\nwe're getting the photons and there's not much processing on it. If you're being able\nto control that signal, maybe you can do some kind of processing. Maybe you do object\ndetection ahead of time. - [DJ] Yeah. - You're doing some\nkind of pre-processing, and there's a lot of\npossibilities to explore that. So it's not just increasing\nsort of thermal imaging, that kind of stuff, but it's\nalso just doing some kind of interesting processing.\n- Correct, yeah. I mean, my theory of how\nlike visual system works also is that, I mean, there's\njust so many things happening in the world, and\nthere's a lot of photons that are going into your\neye, and it's unclear exactly where some of the pre-processing\nsteps are happening. But I mean, I actually think that just from a fundamental perspective,\nthere's just so much, the reality that we're\nin, if it's a reality, is so there's so much data. And I think humans are\njust unable to actually like eat enough actually to\nprocess all that information. So there's some sort of\nfiltering that does happen, whether that happens in the retina, whether that happens in different layers of the visual cortex. Unclear. But like the analogy that\nI sometimes think about is, if your brain is a CCD camera, and all of the information\nin the world is a sun, and when you try to\nactually look at the sun with the CCD camera, it's just gonna saturate\nthe sensors, right? 'Cause it's enormous amount of energy. So what you do is you end up\nadding these filters, right? To just kind of narrow the information that's coming to you and being captured. And I think things like our experiences or our like drugs like propofol, that like anesthetic drug or psychedelics, what they're doing is\nthey're kind of swapping out these filters and putting in\nnew ones or removing older ones and kind of controlling\nour conscious experience. - Yeah, man, not to\ndistract from the topic, but I just took a very\nhigh dose of ayahuasca in the Amazon jungle. So yes, it's a nice way to think about it. You're swapping out different experiences, and with Neuralink being\nable to control that, primarily at first, to improve function, not for entertainment purposes\nor enjoyment purposes, but- - Yeah, giving back lost functions. - Well, giving back lost functions. And there, especially when the\nfunction is completely lost, anything is a huge help. Would you implant a Neuralink\ndevice in your own brain? - Absolutely. I mean, maybe not right\nnow, but absolutely. - What kind of capability, once reached, you would start getting real curious and almost get a little antsy, like jealous of people that get it as you watch them get implanted? - Yeah, I mean I think, I mean, even with our early participants, if they start to do\nthings that I can't do, which I think is in the\nrealm of possibility for them to be able to get, 15, 20, if not like 100 BPS right? There's nothing that\nfundamentally stops us from being able to achieve\nthat type of performance. I mean, I would certainly get\njealous that they can do that. - I should say that watching Noland, I get a little jealous 'cause\nhe's having so much fun, and it seems like such a\nchill way to play video games. - Yeah. So I mean, the thing that also is hard to appreciate sometimes is that, he's doing these things while talking. I mean, it's multitasking, right? So it's clearly, it's obviously cognitively intensive, but similar to how, when we talk, we move our hands, like these\nthings like are multitasking. I mean, he's able to do that. And you won't be able to do that with other assistive\ntechnology as far as I'm aware. If you're obviously using\nlike an eye tracking device, you're very much fixated on that thing that you're trying to do. And if you're using voice control, I mean, like if you say some other stuff, yeah, you don't get to use that. - Yeah, the multitasking aspect of that is really interesting. So it's not just the BPS\nfor the primary task. It's the parallelization\nof multiple tasks. If you measure the BPS for the entirety of the human organism, so if you're talking and\ndoing a thing with your mind and looking around also, I mean, there's just a lot of paralyzation\nthat can be happening. - Yeah. But I mean, I think at some point for him, like if he wants to really\nachieve those high level BPS, it does require like\nfull attention, right? And that's a separate circuitry\nthat is a big mystery. Like how attention works and, you know? - Yeah, attention, like cognitive load, I've read a lot of literature\non people doing two tasks. Like you have your primary\ntask and a secondary task. And the secondary task is\na source of distraction. And how does that affect the performance of the primary task? And depending on the tasks,\nthere's a lot of interesting, I mean, this is an interesting\ncomputational device, right? And I think-\n- To say the least. - A lot of novel insights that can be gained from everything. I mean, I personally am surprised that Noland's able to do\nsuch incredible control of the cursor while talking and also being nervous at the same time, 'cause he's talking like all of us are, if you're talking in front of the camera, you get nervous. So all of those are coming into play, and he is able to still\nachieve high performance. Surprising. I mean, all of this is really amazing. And I think just after\nresearching this really in depth, I kind of want Neuralink. - (laughs) Get in line. - And also, the safety get in line. Well, we should say the registry is for people who have quadriplegia and all that kind of stuff so-\n- Correct. - There'll be a separate line for people. They're just curious, like myself. So now that Noland, patient P1, is part of the ongoing prime study, what's the high level\nvision for P2, P3, P4, P5? And just the expansion\ninto other human beings that are getting to\nexperience this implant? - Yeah, I mean, the primary goal is, for our study in the first place is to achieve safety endpoints. Just understand safety of this device, as well as the implantation process. And also, at the same time,\nunderstand the efficacy and the impact that it could have on the potential users' lives. And just because you have, you're living with tetraplegia, it doesn't mean your situation is same as another person\nliving with tetraplegia. It's wildly, wildly varying. It's something that we're\nhoping to also understand how our technology can serve not just a very small\nslice of those individuals, but broader group of individuals and being able to get the\nfeedback to just really build just the best product for them. There's obviously also goals that we have, and the primary purpose of\nthe early feasibility study is to learn from each\nand every participant to improve the device, improve the surgery before we embark on what's\ncalled a pivotal study that then is much larger trial that starts to look at\nstatistical significance of your endpoints, and that's required before you can then market the device. And that's how it works in the U.S. and just generally around the world. That's the process you follow. So our goal is to really just understand from people like Noland,\nP2, P3, future participants, what aspects of our\ndevice needs to improve. If it turns out that people are like, \"I really don't like the fact\nthat it lasts only six hours. I wanna be able to use this\ncomputer for like 24 hours.\" I mean, that is a user\nneeds and user requirements, which we can only find out from just being able to engage with them. - So before the pivotal study, there's kind of like a rapid innovation based on individual experiences. You're learning from individual\npeople how they use it, like the high resolution details in terms of like cursor control and signal and all that kind of stuff\nto like life experience. - Yeah, yeah, so there's hardware changes but also just firmware updates. So even when we had that sort\nof recovery event for Noland, he now has the new firmware\nthat he has been updated with. And it's similar to how like your phones get updated all the time with new firmware for security patches, whatever new functionality UI, right? And that's something that is\npossible with our implant. It's not a static one-time device that can only do the thing\nthat it said it can do. I mean, it's similar to Tesla. You can do over the air firmware updates, and now you have completely\nnew user interface. And all this bells and\nwhistles and improvements on everything like the latest, right? When we say generalized platform, that's what we're talking about. - Yeah, it's really cool how\nthe app that Noland is using, there's like calibration,\nall that kind of stuff. And then there's update. You just click and get an update. What other future capabilities\nare you kinda looking to? You said vision. That's a fascinating one. What about sort of\naccelerated typing or speech, this kind of stuff? And what else is there? - Yeah, those are still in\nthe realm of movement program. So largely speaking, we have two programs. We have the movement program and we have the vision program. The movement program\ncurrently is focused around the digital freedom. As you can easily guess,\nif you can control 2D cursor in the digital space, you could move anything\nin the physical space. So robotic arms, wheelchair,\nyour environment, or even really like, whether\nit's through the phone or just like directly to those interfaces, so like to those machines. So we're looking at ways to kind of expand those types of capability,\neven for Noland. That requires conversation with the FDA and kind of showing safety data for, if there's a robotic arm or a wheelchair that we can guarantee that\nthey're not gonna hurt themselves accidentally, right? It's very different if you're moving stuff in the digital domain versus\nlike in the physical space, you can actually potentially\ncause harm to the participants. So we're working through that right now. Speech does involve\ndifferent areas of the brain. Speech prosthetic is\nvery, very fascinating, and there's actually been a\nlot of really amazing work that's been happening in academia. Sergei Stavisky at UC\nDavis, Jaimie Henderson, and late Krishna Shenoy at Stanford doing just some incredible amount of work in improving speech neuroprosthetics. And those are actually looking more at parts of the motor cortex that are controlling\nthese focal articulators. And being able to like, even by mouthing the\nword or imagine speech, you can pick up those signals. The more sophisticated higher\nlevel processing areas, like the Broca's area or Wernicke's area, those are still very, very big mystery in terms of the underlying mechanism of how all that stuff works. But yeah, I mean, I think\nNeuralink's event goal is to kind of understand those things and be able to provide\na platform and tools to be able to understand\nthat and study that. - This is where I get to\nthe pothead questions. Do you think we can start getting insight into things like thought? So speech is, there's a muscular\ncomponent, like you said. There's like the act of producing sounds. But then what about the\ninternal things like cognition? Like low level thoughts\nand high level thoughts. Do you think we'll start noticing kind of signals that could be picked up? They could be understood,\nthey could be maybe used in order to interact\nwith the outside world. - In some ways, like I guess this starts to kind of get into the heart\nproblem of consciousness. And I mean, on one hand, all of these are, at some point, set of electrical signals, that from there, maybe it in itself is giving you the\ncognition or the meaning, or somehow, human mind\nis incredibly amazing storytelling machine. So we're telling ourselves\nand fooling ourselves that there's some\ninteresting meaning here. But I mean, I certainly think that BCI and really BCI at the end of the day is a set of tools that\nhelp you kind of study the underlying mechanisms\nin both like local but also broader sense. And whether there's some\ninteresting patterns of like electrical signal, that means like you're\nthinking this versus, and you can either like learn from like many, many sets of\ndata to correlate some of that and be able to do mind reading or not. I'm not sure. I certainly would not\nkind of rule that out as a possibility, but I think BCI alone probably can't do that. There's probably additional\nset of tools and framework. And also, like just heart\nproblem of consciousness at the end of the day is rooted in this philosophical question of like, what's the meaning of it all? What's the nature of our existence? Where's the mind emerge\nfrom this complex network? - Yeah, how does the\nsubjective experience emerge from just a bunch of\nspikes, electrical spikes? - Yeah, yeah, I mean, we\ndo really think about BCI and what we're building as a tool for understanding the mind, the brain. The only question that matters. There's actually, there actually is some\nbiological existence proof of like what it would take\nto kind of start to form some of these experiences\nthat may be unique. If you actually look at\nevery one of our brains, there are two hemispheres. There's a left-sided brain,\nthere's a right-sided brain. And I mean, unless you\nhave some other conditions, you normally don't feel like\nleft legs or right legs. Like you just feel like one legs, right? So what is happening there, right? If you actually look\nat the two hemispheres, there's a structure that\nkind of characterize the two called the corpus callosum\nthat is supposed to have around 200 to 300 million\nconnections or axons. So whether that means that's\nthe number of interface and electrodes that we need to create some sort of\nmind meld, or from that, like whatever new conscious experience that you can experience. But yeah, I do think that there's like kind of an interesting existence\nproof that we all have. - And that threshold is\nunknown at this time. - Oh yeah, these things, everything in this domain\nis speculation, right? - And then there would be, you'd be continuously\npleasantly surprised. Do you see a world where\nthere's millions of people, like tens of millions,\nhundreds of millions of people walking around with a Neuralink device, or multiple Neuralink\ndevices in their brain? - I do. First of all, there are, like if you look at\nworldwide, people suffering from movement disorders\nand visual deficits. I mean, that's in the tens if not hundreds of millions of people. So that alone, I think,\nthere's a lot of benefit and potential good that we can do with this type of technology. And once you start to\nget into kind of neuro, like psychiatric application, depression, anxiety, hunger, or obesity, right? Like mood, control of appetite, I mean, that starts to\nbecome very real to everyone. - Not to mention that most people on earth have a smartphone. And once BCI starts\ncompeting with a smartphone as a preferred methodology of interacting with the digital world, that also becomes an interesting thing. - Oh yeah, I mean, yeah. This is even before going to that, right? I mean, there's like almost, I mean, the entire world that could benefit from\nthese types of thing. And then, yeah, like\nif we're talking about kind of next generation\nof how we interface with machines or even ourselves, in many ways, I think BCI\ncan play a role in that. And some of the things\nthat I also talk about is I do think that there\nis a real possibility that you could see eight billion people walking around with Neuralink. - Well, thank you so\nmuch for pushing ahead. And I look forward to\nthat exciting feature. - Thanks for having me. - Thanks for listening to\nthis conversation with DJ Seo. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Matthew MacDougall, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. When did you first become\nfascinated with the human brain? - Since forever. As far back as I can remember, I've been interested in the human brain. I mean, I was a thoughtful kid and a bit of an outsider. And you sit there thinking about what the most important\nthings in the world are in your little tiny adolescent brain. And the answer that I came to, that I converged on was\nthat all of the things you can possibly conceive of,\nas things that are important for human beings to care about are literally contained in the skull. Both the perception of them\nand their relative values. And the solutions to all our problems and all of our problems are\nall contained in the skull. And if we knew more about how that worked, how the brain encodes information and generates desires and\ngenerates agony and suffering, we could do more about it. You think about all the\nreally great triumphs in human history. You think about all the\nreally horrific tragedies. You think about the holocaust, you think about any prison\nfull of human stories, and all of those problems\nboil down to neurochemistry. So if you get a little\nbit of control over that, you provide people the\noption to do better. And in the way I read history, the way people have dealt\nwith having better tools is that they most often\nin the end do better, with huge asterisk. But I think it's an interesting, a worthy and noble pursuit to give people more options, more tools. - Yeah, that's a fascinating\nway to look at human history. You just imagine all these\nneurobiological mechanisms, Stalin, Hitler, all of these, Gengis Khan, all of them just had like a brain, just a bunch of neurons, like a few tons of billions of neurons gaining a bunch of information\nover a period of time. They have a set of module that does language and\nmemory and all that. And from there, in the\ncase of those people, they're able to murder millions of people. - [Matthew] Yeah. - All that coming from, there's not some glorified\nnotion of a dictator of this enormous mind\nor something like this. It's just the brain. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, a lot of that\nhas to do with how well people like that can\norganize those around them. - Other brains. - Yeah, and so I always\nfind it interesting to look to primatology, look to our closest non-human relatives for clues as to how\nhumans are going to behave and what particular humans\nare able to achieve. And so you look at chimpanzees and bonobos and they're similar but different in their social structures particularly. And I went to Emory in Atlanta and studied under Frans,\nthe great Frans de Waal, who was kind of the leading\nprimatologist who recently died, and his work at looking\nat chimps through the lens of how you would watch\nan episode of \"Friends\" and understand the motivations of the characters\ninteracting with each other. He would look at a chimp colony and basically apply that lens. I'm massively oversimplifying it. If you do that, instead of just saying, subject 473 through his\nfeces at subject 471, you talk about them in terms\nof their human struggles, accord them the dignity\nof themselves as actors with understandable goals and drives, what they want out of life. And primarily, it's the\nthings we want out of life: food, sex, companionship, power. You can understand chimp\nand bonobo behavior in the same lights much more easily. And I think doing so gives\nyou the tools you need to reduce human behavior from\nthe kind of false complexity that we layer onto it with language and look at it in terms of, oh, well, these humans are\nlooking for companionship, sex, food, power. And I think that's a pretty powerful tool to have in understanding human behavior. - And I just went to the\nAmazon jungle for a few weeks, and it's a very visceral reminder that a lot of life on earth\nis just trying to get laid. They're all screaming at each other. Like I saw a lot of monkeys, and they're just trying\nto impress each other, or maybe if there's a battle for power, but a lot of the battle for power has to do with them getting laid. - Right. Breeding rights often\ngo with alpha status. And so if you can get a piece of that, then you're gonna do okay. - And would like to think that we're somehow\nfundamentally different, but especially when it comes to primates, we're really aren't, you know. We can use fancier poetic language, but maybe some of the underlying drives that motivate us are similar. - Yeah, I think that's true. - And all of that is coming\nfrom this, the brain. - Yeah.\n- So when did you first start studying the brain as I guess as a biological mechanism? - Basically, the moment I got to college, I started looking around for labs that I could do neuroscience work in. I originally approached\nthat from the angle of looking at interactions\nbetween the brain and the immune system, which\nisn't the most obvious place to start, but I had this idea at the time that the contents of your\nthoughts would have an impact, a direct impact, maybe a powerful one on non-conscious systems in your body. The systems we think of as homeostatic, automatic mechanisms like\nfighting off a virus, like repairing a wound. And sure enough, there are big\ncrossovers between the two. I mean, it gets to kind of a key point that I think goes under recognized. One of the things people don't recognize or appreciate about\nthe human brain enough, and that is that it basically controls or has a huge role in almost\neverything that your body does. Like you try to name an example of something in your body\nthat isn't directly controlled or massively influenced by the\nbrain, and it's pretty hard. I mean, you might say like\nbone healing or something, but even those systems, the\nhypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in\ncoordinating the endocrine system that does have a direct influence on, say, the calcium level in your blood\nthat goes to bone healing. So non-obvious connections\nbetween those things implicate the brain as really a potent prime mover in all of health. - One of the things I realized\nin the other direction too, how most of the systems in the body integrated with the human brain, like they affect the brain\nalso, like the immune system. I think there's just people\nwho study Alzheimer's and those kinds of things. It's just surprising how\nmuch you can understand of that from the immune\nsystem, from the other systems that don't obviously seem\nto have anything to do with sort of the nervous system. They all play together. - Yeah, you could\nunderstand how that would be driven by evolution too,\njust in some simple examples. If you get sick, if you\nget a communicable disease, you get the flu, it's pretty advantageous for your immune system to tell your brain, \"Hey, now be antisocial for a few days. Don't go be the life of the party tonight. In fact, maybe just\ncuddle up somewhere warm under a blanket and just\nstay there for a day or two.\" And sure enough, that\ntends to be the behavior that you see both in\nanimals and in humans. If you get sick, elevated\nlevels of interleukins in your blood and TNF alpha in your blood ask the brain to cut\nback on social activity. And even moving around, you have lower locomotor activity in animals that are infected with viruses. - So from there, the early days\nin neuroscience to surgery, when did that step happen? - Yeah.\n- This is a leap. - It was sort of an evolution of thought. I wanted to study the brain. I started studying the brain in undergrad in this neuroimmunology lab. I, from there, realized at some point that I didn't wanna\njust generate knowledge. I wanted to effect real\nchanges in the actual world, in actual people's lives. And so after having not\nreally thought about going into medical school, I was on a track to go into a PhD program. I said, \"Well, I'd like that option. I'd like to actually potentially help tangible people in front of me.\" And doing a little digging\nfound that there exists these MD-PhD programs where\nyou can choose not to choose between them and do both. And so I went to USC for medical school and had a joint PhD program with Caltech, where I actually chose\nthat program particularly because of a researcher at\nCaltech named Richard Andersen, who's one of the godfathers\nof primate neuroscience and has a MACAC lab where Utah arrays and other electrodes were being inserted into the brains of monkeys\nto try to understand how intentions were being\nencoded in the brain. So I ended up there with the idea that maybe I would be a neurologist and study the brain on the side, and then discovered that neurology, again, I'm gonna make\nenemies by saying this, but neurology predominantly and distressingly to me is the practice of diagnosing a thing and then saying, \"Good luck with that. There's not much we can do.\" And neurosurgery, very differently, it's a powerful lever on taking people that are headed in a bad direction\nand changing their course in the sense of brain tumors that are potentially treatable\nor curable with surgery. Even aneurysms in the brain, blood vessels that are gonna rupture, you can save lives really is at the end of the\nday, what mattered to me. And so I was at USC, as I mentioned, that happens to be one of the\ngreat neurosurgery programs. And so I met these truly\nepic neurosurgeons, Alex Khalessi and Mike\nApuzzo and Steve Giannotta and Marty Weiss, these sort of epic people that were just human\nbeings in front of me. And so it kind of changed my thinking from neurosurgeons are distant gods that live on another planet and occasionally come and visit us to these are humans that\nhave problems and are people. And there's nothing\nfundamentally preventing me from being one of them. And so at the last\nminute in medical school, I changed gears from going\ninto a different specialty and switched into neurosurgery,\nwhich cost me a year. I had to do another year of research, because I was so far along in the process to switch into neurosurgery. The deadlines had already passed. So it was a decision that cost time, but absolutely worth it. - What was the hardest\npart of the training on the neurosurgeon track? - Yeah, two things. I think that residency in neurosurgery is sort of a competition of pain, of like how much pain\ncan you eat and smile. - Yeah.\n- And so there's workout restrictions that are not really, they're viewed at, I think, internally among the residents as weakness. And so most neurosurgery residents try to work as hard as they can. And that I think necessarily\nmeans working long hours, and sometimes, over the work hour limits. And we care about being compliant with whatever regulations\nare in front of us. But I think more important than that, people wanna give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon, because the stakes are so high. And so it's a real fight to get residents to say go home at the end of their shift and not stay and do more surgery. - Are you seriously saying\nlike one of the hardest things is literally like\nforcing them to get sleep and rest and all this kind of stuff? - Historically, that was the case. I think the next generation, I think the next generation\nis more compliant and more selfcare-\n- Weaker is what you mean. All right, I'm just\nkidding, I'm just kidding. - I didn't say it. - Now I'm making enemies. Okay, I get it. Wow, that's fascinating. So what was the second thing? - The personalities. And maybe the two are connected, but- - Was it pretty competitive? - It's competitive and it's also, as we touched on earlier,\nprimates like power, and I think neurosurgery\nhas long had this aura of mystique and excellence\nand whatever about it. And so it's an invitation\nI think for people that are cloaked in that authority. A board certified\nneurosurgeon is basically a walking fallacious\nappeal to authority, right? You have license to walk into any room and act like you're an expert on whatever. And fighting that tendency is not something that most\nneurosurgeons do well. Humility isn't the forte. - Yeah, so I have friends who know you, and whenever they speak about you, that you have the surprising quality for a neurosurgeon of humility, which I think indicates\nthat it's not as common as perhaps in other professions, 'cause there is a kind of gigantic sort of heroic aspect to neurosurgery, and I think it gets to\npeople's head a little bit. - Yeah. Well, I think that allows me to play well at an Elon company. Because Elon, one of his strengths, I think, is to just instantly see through fallacy from authority. So nobody walks into a\nroom that he's in and says, \"Well, goddamn it, you have to trust me. I'm the guy that built the\nlast 10 rockets or something.\" And he says, \"Well, you did it wrong and we can do it better.\" Or, \"I'm the guy that kept Ford alive for the last 50 years. You listen to me on how to build cars.\" And he says no. And so you don't walk\ninto a room that he's in and say, \"Well, I'm a neurosurgeon. Let me tell you how to do it.\" He's gonna say, \"Well, I'm a\nhuman being that has a brain. I can think from first principles myself, thank you very much. And here's how I think\nit ought to be done. Let's go try it and see who's right.\" And that's proven I think\nover and over in his case to be a very powerful approach. - If we just take that tangent, there's a fascinating\ninterdisciplinary team at Neuralink that you get to interact\nwith, including Elon. What do you think is the\nsecret to a successful team? What have you learned from just getting to observe these folks? World experts in different\ndisciplines work together. - Yeah, there's a sweet\nspot where people disagree and forcefully speak their mind and passionately defend their position, and yet are still able to\naccept information from others and change their ideas when they're wrong. And so I like the analogy of sort of how you polish rocks. You put hard things in a\nhard container and spin it. People bash against each other and outcome's a more refined product. And so to make a good team at Neuralink, we've tried to find\npeople that are not afraid to defend their ideas passionately. And occasionally, strongly\ndisagree with people that they're working with and have the best idea come out on top. It's not an easy balance, again, to refer back to the primate brain. It's not something that is inherently built into the primate brain to say, \"I passionately put all\nmy chips on this position and now I'm just gonna walk away from it. Admit you were right.\" Part of our brains tell us\nthat that is a power loss. That is a loss of face, a loss of standing in the community. And now, you're a zeta chimp, 'cause your idea got trounced. And you just have to recognize\nthat that little voice in the back of your head is maladaptive and it's not helping the team win. - Yeah, you have to have the confidence to be able to walk away from\nan idea that you hold onto. Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And if you do that often enough, you're actually going to become the best in the world at your thing. I mean, that kind of that rapid iteration. - Yeah, you'll at least be\na member of a winning team. - Ride the wave. What did you learn? You mentioned there's a lot of\namazing neurosurgeons at USC. What lessons about surgery and life have you learned from those folks? - Yeah, I think working\nyour ass off, working hard while functioning as a member of a team, getting a job done that\nis incredibly difficult, working incredibly long\nhours, being up all night, taking care of someone that you think probably won't\nsurvive no matter what you do. Working hard to make people\nthat you passionately dislike look good the next morning. These folks were\nrelentless in their pursuit of excellent neurosurgical\ntechnique decade over decade. And I think we're well-recognized\nfor that excellence. Especially Marty Weiss,\nSteve Giannotta, Mike Apuzzo, they made huge contributions\nnot only to surgical technique, but they built training\nprograms that trained dozens or hundreds of\namazing neurosurgeons. I was just lucky to kind\nof be in their wake. - What's that like, you\nmentioned doing a surgery where the person is likely not to survive. Does that wear on you? - Yeah. It's especially challenging when you, with all respect to our elders, it doesn't hit so much when you're taking care of an 80-year-old and something was going to\nget them pretty soon anyway. And so you lose a patient like that, and it was part of the natural course of what is expected of them in\nthe coming years, regardless. Taking care of a father of\ntwo or three, four young kids, someone in their 30s that\ndidn't have it coming, and they show up in your ER having their first seizure of their life, and lo and behold, they've\ngot a huge, malignant, inoperable or incurable brain tumor. You can only do that, I\nthink, a handful of times before it really starts\neating away at your armor. Or a young mother that shows up that has a giant hemorrhage in her brain that she's not gonna survive from. And they bring her four-year-old daughter to say goodbye one last time before they turn the ventilator off. The great Henry Marsh is\na English neurosurgeon who said it best. I think he says that every neurosurgeon carries with them a private graveyard, and I definitely feel that, especially with young parents. That kills me. They had a lot more to give. The loss of those people specifically has a knock on effect that's\ngoing to make the world worse for people for a long time. And it's just hard to feel\npowerless in the face of that. And that's where I think you\nhave to be borderline evil to fight against a company like Neuralink or to constantly be taking pot shots at us because what we're doing is\nto try to fix that stuff. We're trying to give people options, to reduce suffering. We're trying to take the pain out of life that broken brains brings in. And yeah, this is just our little way that we're fighting back\nagainst entropy, I guess. - Yeah, the amount of\nsuffering that's endured when some of the things\nthat we take for granted that our brain is able to\ndo is taken away is immense. And to be able to restore some of that functionality is a real gift. - Yeah, we're just starting. We're gonna do so much more. - Well, can you take me\nthrough the full procedure of implanting, say, the\nN1 chip in Neuralink? - Yeah, it's a really simple, really simple, straightforward procedure. The human part of the surgery\nthat I do is dead simple. It's one of the most basic neurosurgery procedures imaginable. And I think there's evidence\nthat some version of it has been done for thousands of years. That there are examples I\nthink from ancient Egypt of healed or partially healed\ntrephinations from Peru or ancient times in South America where these protosurgeons would drill holes in people's skulls, presumably to let out the evil spirits, but maybe to drain blood clots. And there's evidence of bone\nhealing around the edge, meaning the people at least survive some months after a procedure. And so what we're doing is that. We are making a cut in the\nskin on the top of the head over the area of the brain\nthat is the most potent representation of hand intentions. And so if you are an\nexpert concert pianist, this part of your brain is lighting up the entire time you're playing. We call it the hand knob. - The hand knob.\n- Yeah. - So it's all like the finger movement. All of that is just firing away. - Yep, there's a little squiggle\nin the cortex right there. One of the folds in the brain is kind of doubly folded\nright on that spot. So you can look at it on an MRI and say, \"That's the hand knob.\" And then you do a functional test and a special kind of MRI called\nan a functional MRI, fMRI. And this part of the brain\nlights up when people, even quadriplegic people whose brains aren't connected to their\nfinger movements anymore. They imagine finger movements, and this part of the\nbrain still lights up. So we can ID that part of the brain in anyone who's preparing\nto enter our trial and say, \"Okay, that part of the brain, we confirm, is your hand intention area.\" And so I'll make a little cut in the skin, we'll flap the skin open, just like kind of opening\nthe hood of a car, only a lot smaller. Make a perfectly round one inch\ndiameter hole in the skull, remove that bit of skull, open the lining of the brain,\nthe covering of the brain. It's like a little bag of\nwater that the brain floats in. And then show that part\nof the brain to our robot. And then this is where the robot shines. It can come in and take these tiny, much smaller than human hair electrodes and precisely insert them into the cortex, into the surface of the brain\nto a very precise depth, in a very precise spot that\navoids all the blood vessels that are coating the surface of the brain. And after the robot's done with its part, then the human comes back\nin and puts the implant into that hole in the\nskull and covers it up, screwing it down to the skull and sewing the skin back together. So the whole thing is a few hours long. It's extremely low risk compared\nto the average neurosurgery involving the brain that might say, open up a deep part of the brain or manipulate blood vessels in the brain. This opening on the surface of the brain, with only cortical micro insertions, carries significantly less risk than a lot of the tumor\nor aneurysm surgeries that are routinely done. - So cortical micro\ninsertions that are via robot and computer vision are designed\nto avoid the blood vessels. - Exactly. - So I know you're a bit biased here, but let's compare human and machine. - Sure.\n- So what are human surgeons able to do well, and what are robot\nsurgeons able to do well at this stage of our human\ncivilization development? - Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. Humans are general purpose machines. We're able to adapt to unusual situations. We're able to change the plan on the fly. I remember well a surgery that\nI was doing many years ago down in San Diego, where the\nplan was to open a small hole behind the ear and go\nreposition a blood vessel that had come to lay on the facial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, the\nnerve that goes to the face. When that blood vessel lays on the nerve, it can cause just intolerable,\nhorrific shooting pain that people describe like being\nzapped with a cattle prod. And so the beautiful, elegant surgery is to go move this blood\nvessel off the nerve. The surgery team, we went in there and started moving this blood vessel and then found that there\nwas a giant aneurysm on that blood vessel that\nwas not easily visible on the pre-op scans. And so the plan had to dynamically change, and the human surgeons\nhad no problem with that. We're trained for all those things. Robots wouldn't do so\nwell in that situation, at least in their current incarnation, fully robotic surgery, like the electrode insertion portion of the Neuralink surgery. It goes according to a set plan. And so the humans can interrupt the flow and change the plan, but the robot can't really change the\nplan midway through. It operates according\nto how it was programmed and how it was asked to run. It does its job very precisely, but not with a wide degree of latitude and how to react to changing conditions. - So there could be just a\nvery large number of ways that you could be surprised as a surgeon when you enter a situation\nthat could be subtle things that you have to dynamically adjust to. - Correct.\n- And robots are not good at that. - Currently.\n- Currently. I think we are at the\ndawn of a new era with AI of the parameters for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened, right? I mean, you can't look\nat a self-driving car and say that it's operating\nunder very narrow parameters. If a chicken runs across the road, it wasn't necessarily\nprogrammed to deal with that, specifically, but a Waymo\nor a self-driving Tesla would have no problem reacting\nto that appropriately. And so surgical robots aren't\nthere yet, but give it time. - And then there could be a lot of, sort of into like\nsemi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a robotic surgeon could say, this situation is perfectly familiar, or the situation is not familiar. And in the not familiar case,\na human could take over. But basically like be very\nconservative in saying, \"Okay, this for sure has\nno issues, no surprises, and let the humans deal\nwith the surprises, with the edge cases, all that.\" That's one possibility. So you think eventually,\nyou'll be out of the job? Well, you being neurosurgeon, your job being neurosurgeon. Humans, there will not\nbe many neurosurgeons left on this earth. - I'm not worried about my job in the course of my professional life. I think I would tell my\nmy kids not necessarily to go in this line of work depending on how things look in 20 years. - It's so fascinating, 'cause I mean, if I have a line of work, I\nwould say it's programming. And if you ask me like for the\nlast, I don't know, 20 years, what I would recommend for people, I would tell 'em, yeah, go. You will always have a job\nif you're a programmer, 'cause there's more and more computers and all this kind of\nstuff and it pays well. But then you realize these\nlarge language models come along and they're really\ndamn good at generating code. So overnight, you could be surprised like, \"Wow, like what is the\ncontribution of the human really?\" But then you start to think, \"Okay, it does seem like\nhumans have ability, like you said, to deal\nwith novel situations.\" In the case of programming,\nit's the ability to kinda come up with novel\nideas to solve problems. It seems like machines aren't\nquite yet able to do that. And when the stakes are very high, when it's life critical,\nas it is in surgery, especially in neurosurgery, the stakes are very high for a robot to actually replace a human. But it's fascinating that\nin this case of Neuralink, there's a human-robot collaboration. - Yeah, yeah. I do the parts it can't do, and it does the parts I can't do. And we are friends. (Lex laughing) - I saw that there's a\nlot of practice going on. So I mean, everything in Neuralink is tested extremely rigorously. But one of the things I\nsaw, that there's a proxy on which the surgeries are performed. - Yeah.\n- So this is both for the robot and for the human, for everybody involved\nin the entire pipeline. What's that like practicing the surgery? - It's pretty intense. So there's no analog to\nthis in human surgery. Human surgery is sort\nof this artisanal craft that's handed down directly from master to pupil over the generations. I mean, literally the way you learn to be a surgeon on humans is\nby doing surgery on humans. I mean, first, you watch your professors do a bunch of surgery, and then finally, they\nput the trivial parts of the surgery into your hands, and then the more complex parts. And as your understanding of the point and the purposes of the surgery increases, you get more responsibility\nin the perfect condition. Doesn't always go well. In Neuralink's case, the\napproach is a bit different. We, of course, practiced as\nfar as we could on animals. We did hundreds of animal surgeries. And when it came time\nto do the first human, we had just amazing\nteam of engineers build incredibly lifelike models. One of the engineers, Fran\nRomano, in particular built a pulsating brain in a\ncustom 3D printed skull that matches exactly\nthe patient's anatomy, including their face and\nscalp characteristics. And so when I was able to practice that, I mean, it's as close as it\nreally reasonably should get to being the real thing\nand all the details, including the having a mannequin body attached to this custom head. And so when we were doing\nthe practice surgeries, we'd wheel that body into the CT scanner and take a mock CT scan\nand wheel it back in and conduct all the normal\nsafety checks verbally. \"Stop, this patient, we're\nconfirming his identification, is mannequin number blah, blah, blah.\" And then opening the brain\nin exactly the right spot using standard operative\nneuronavigation equipment, standard surgical drills in the same OR that we do all of our practice\nsurgeries in at Neuralink. And having the skull open\nand have the brain pulse, which adds a degree of\ndifficulty for the robot to perfectly precisely plan\nand insert those electrodes to the right depth and location. And so yeah, we kind of broke new ground on how extensively we\npracticed for this surgery. - So there was a historic moment, a big milestone for Neuralink in part for humanity with the first human getting a Neuralink implant\nin January of this year. Take me through the surgery on Noland. What did it feel like to be part of this? - Yeah. Well, we're lucky to have\njust incredible partners at the Barrow Neurologic Institute. They are, I think, the premier neurosurgical hospital in the world. They made everything as easy as possible for the trial to get going\nand helped us immensely with their expertise on\nhow to arrange the details. It was a much more high\npressure surgery in some ways. I mean, even though the\noutcome wasn't particularly in question in terms of\nour participant safety, the number of observers,\nthe number of people, there's conference rooms full of people watching live streams in the hospital, rooting for this to go perfectly, and that just adds pressure\nthat is not typical for even the most intense\nproduction neurosurgery. Say, removing a tumor or placing deep brain stimulation electrodes. And it had never been\ndone on a human before. There were unknown unknowns. And so definitely, a\nmoderate pucker factor there for the whole team, not knowing if we were going to encounter, say, a degree of brain\nmovement that was unanticipated or a degree of brain\nsag that took the brain far away from the skull and\nmade it difficult to insert or some other unknown unknown problem. Fortunately, everything went well and that surgery is one of the smoothest outcomes we could have imagined. - Were you nervous? I mean, you're a bit quarterback in the Super Bowl kind of situation. - Extremely nervous. Extremely. I was very pleased when it went well and when it was over. Looking forward to number two.\n- Yeah. Even with all that practice, all of that, you've never been in a situation that's still high stakes in\nterms of people watching. And we should also probably mention, given how the media\nworks, a lot of people, maybe in a dark kind of way,\nhoping it doesn't go well. - Well, I think wealth is easy to hate or envy or whatever. And I think there's a whole\nindustry around driving clicks, and bad news is great for clicks. And so any way to take an\nevent and turn it into bad news is gonna be really good for clicks. - It just sucks because I think\nit puts pressure on people. It discourages people from trying to solve really hard problems, because\nto solve hard problems, you have to go into the unknown. You have to do things that\nhaven't been done before, and you have to take risks. - Yeah.\n- Calculated risks. You have to do all kinds\nof safety precautions, but risks nevertheless. And I just wish there would\nbe more celebration of that, of the risk taking versus\nlike people just waiting on the sidelines, like\nwaiting for failure, and then pointing out the failure. Yeah, it sucks. But in this case, it's\nreally great that everything went just flawlessly, but it's unnecessary\npressure, I would say. - Now that there's a human\nwith literal skin in the game, there's a participant whose wellbeing rides on this doing well, you have to be a pretty bad person to be rooting for that to go wrong. And so hopefully, people\nlook in the mirror and realize that at some point. - So did you get to\nactually front row seat like watch the robot work? You get to see the whole thing? - Yeah, I mean, because an\nMD needs to be in charge of all of the medical decision making throughout the process, I\nunscrubbed from the surgery after exposing the brain and\npresenting it to the robot and placed the targets on the robot software interface that tells the robot where it's going to insert\neach thread that was done with my hand on the mouse,\nfor whatever that's worth. - So you were the one placing the targets? - Yeah.\n- Oh, cool. So like the robot with a computer vision provides a bunch of candidates and you kinda finalize the decision. - Right. The software engineers\nare amazing on this team. And so they actually provided an interface where you can essentially use a lasso tool and select a prime area\nof brain real estate, and it will automatically\navoid the blood vessels in that region and automatically\nplace a bunch of targets. So that allows the human robot operator to select really good areas of brain and make dense applications\nof targets in those regions, the regions we think are gonna have the most high fidelity representations of finger movements and\narm movement intentions. - I've seen like images of this. And for me, with OCD, it's for some reason a really pleasant, I think there's a subreddit\ncalled oddly satisfying. - [Matthew] Yeah, love that subreddit. - It's oddly satisfying to\nsee the different target sites avoiding the blood vessels\nand also maximizing like the usefulness of those\nlocations for the signal. It just feels good. It's like, ah. - As a person who has a visceral reaction to the brain bleeding, I can tell you it's extremely satisfying watching the electrodes\nthemselves go into the brain and not cause bleeding. - Yeah, yeah. So you said the feeling was of relief when everything went perfectly. - Yeah. - How deep in the brain\ncan you currently go and eventually go, let's\nsay, on the Neuralink side. It seems the deeper you go in the brain, the more challenging it becomes. - Yeah, so talking broadly\nabout neurosurgery, we can get anywhere. It's routine for me to put deep\nbrain stimulating electrodes near the very bottom of the brain, entering from the top and passing about a two millimeter wire all the way into the bottom of the brain. And that's not revolutionary. A lot of people do that. And we can do that with\nvery high precision. I use a robot from\nGlobus to do that surgery several times a month. It's pretty routine. - What are your eyes in that situation? What are you seeing? What kind of technology\ncan you use to visualize where you are to light your way? - Yeah, so it's a cool\nprocess on the software side. You take a preoperative MRI that's extremely high resolution\ndata of the entire brain. You put the patient to sleep, put their head in a frame that holds the skull very rigidly, and then you take a CT scan of their head while they're asleep with that frame on, and then merge the MRI\nand the CT in software. You have a plan based on the MRI where you can see these\nnuclei deep in the brain. You can't see them on CT, but if you trust the\nmerging of the two images, then you indirectly know\non the CT where that is. And therefore, indirectly know where in reference to the titanium frame screwed to their head those targets are. And so this is '60s\ntechnology to manually compute trajectories, given the\nentry point and target and dial in some goofy\nlooking titanium actuators with a manual actuators with\nlittle tick marks on them. The modern version of\nthat is to use a robot. Just like a little KUKA arm, you might see it building\ncars at the Tesla factory. This small robot arm can\nshow you the trajectory that you intended from the pre-op MRI and establish a very rigid holder through which you can drill\na small hole in the skull and pass a small rigid wire\ndeep into that area of the brain that's hollow and put your electrode through that hollow wire and then remove all of\nthat except the electrode. So you end up with the electrode very, very precisely placed\nfar from the skull surface. Now that's standard\ntechnology that's already, been out in the world for a while. Neuralink right now is focused\nentirely on cortical targets, surface targets because\nthere's no trivial way to get, say, hundreds of wires\ndeep inside the brain without doing a lot of damage. So your question, what do you see? Well, I see an MRI on a screen. I can't see everything\nthat that DBS electrode is passing through on its\nway to that deep target. And so it's accepted with this approach that there's gonna be about\nwhat one in a hundred patients who have a bleed somewhere in the brain as a result of passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain. That's not an acceptable\nsafety profile for Neuralink. We start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three orders of\nmagnitude safer than that. Safe enough really that you or I, without a profound medical problem, might on our lunch break someday say, \"Yeah, sure, I'll get that. I'd be meaning to upgrade\nto the latest version.\" And so the safety constraints\ngiven that are high. And so we haven't settled\non a final solution for arbitrarily approaching\ndeep targets in the brain. - It's interesting 'cause\nlike you have to avoid blood vessels somehow. Maybe there's creative ways\nof doing the same thing, like mapping out high resolution\ngeometry of blood vessels and then you can go in blind. But how do you map out that in a way that's like super stable? There's a lot of interesting\nchallenges there, right? - [Matthew] Yeah. - But there's a lot to do on the surface. Luckily.\n- Exactly. So we've got vision on the surface. We actually have made a\nhuge amount of progress sewing electrodes into the spinal cord as a potential workaround\nfor a spinal cord injury that would allow a brain-mounted implant to translate motor intentions\nto a spine-mounted implant that can effect muscle contractions in previously paralyzed arms and legs. - That's mind-blowing. That's just incredible. So like the effort there\nis to try to bridge the brain to the spinal cord to the peripheral nervous system. So how hard is that to do? - We have that working in\nvery crude forms in animals. - That's amazing.\n- Yeah, we've done- - So similar to like with Noland, where he's able to\ndigitally move the cursor, here you're doing the\nsame kind of communication but with the actual factors that you have. - Yeah. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - Yeah, so we have anesthetized\nanimals doing grasp and moving their legs in\na sort of walking pattern. Again, early days, but the future is bright\nfor this kind of thing. And people with paralysis should look forward to that bright future. They're gonna have options. - Yeah, and there's a lot\nof sort of intermediate or extra options where you\ntake like an Optimus robot, like the arm, and to be\nable to control the arm. The fingers and hands of\nthe arm as a prosthetic. - So skeletons are getting better too. - So skeletons. Yeah, so that goes hand in hand. Although I didn't quite understand until thinking about it deeply and doing more research about Neuralink, how much you can do on the digital side. So this digital telepathy, I didn't quite understand that you can really map the intention, as you described in the hand knob area, that you can map the intention. Just imagine it, think about it. That intention can be mapped to actual action in the digital world. And now more and more, so much can be done in the digital world\nthat it can reconnect you to the outside world. It can allow you to have freedom, have independence if\nyou're a quadriplegic. That's really powerful. Like you can go really far with that. - Yeah, our first\nparticipant, he's incredible. He's breaking world\nrecords left and right. - And he is having fun\nwith it, it's great. Just going back to the\nsurgery, your whole journey, you mentioned to me offline,\nyou have surgery on Monday. So you're like doing surgery all the time. - Yeah. - Maybe the ridiculous question, what does it take to get good at surgery? - Practice, repetitions. Same with anything else. There's a million ways of\npeople saying the same thing and selling books saying it, but you call it 10,000\nhours, you call it, you know, spend some chunk of your life, some percentage of your\nlife focusing on this, obsessing about getting better at it. Repetitions, humility, recognizing\nthat you aren't perfect at any stage along the way. Recognizing you've got improvements to make in your technique. Being open to feedback and coaching from people with a different\nperspective on how to do it. And then just the constant\nwill to do better. That fortunately, if\nyou're not a sociopath, I think your patients bring that with them to the office visits every day. They force you to wanna\ndo better all the time. - Yeah, to step up. I mean, it's a real human being, a real human being that you can help. - Yeah.\n- So every surgery, even if it's the same exact surgery, is there a lot of variability between that surgery\nand a different person? - Yeah, a fair bit. I mean, a good example for\nus is the angle of the skull relative to the normal\nplane of the body axis, of the skull over hand knob\nis pretty wide variation. I mean, some people\nhave really flat skulls, and some people have really steeply angled skulls over that area. And that has consequences for\nhow their head can be fixed in sort of the frame that we use and how the robot has\nto approach the skull. Yeah, people's bodies\nare built as differently as the people you see\nwalking down the street, as much variability in body\nshape and size as you see there. We see in brain anatomy and skull anatomy, there are some people who\nwe've had to kind of exclude from our trial for having skulls that are too thick or too thin or scalp that's too thick or too thin. I think we have like the\nmiddle 97% or so of people, but you can't account for all\nhuman anatomy variability. - How much like mushiness\nand messes there, 'cause taking biology classes, the diagrams are always\nreally clean and crisp. Neuroscience, the pictures of neurons are always really nice and vary. But whenever I look at\npictures of like real brains, I don't know what is going on. - Yeah.\n- So how much are biological systems in reality? Like how hard is it to\nfigure out what's going on? - Not too bad. Once you really get used to this, that's where experience\nand skill and education really come into play is if\nyou stare at a thousand brains, it becomes easier to kind\nof mentally peel back the, say, for instance, blood vessels that are obscuring the sulci and gyri, kind of the wrinkle pattern\nof the surface of the brain. Occasionally, when you're\nfirst starting to do this and you open the skull, it doesn't match what you thought you were\ngonna see based on the MRI. And with more experience, you\nlearn to kind of peel back that layer of blood vessels and see the underlying pattern\nof wrinkles in the brain and use that as a landmark\nfor where you are. - [Lex] The wrinkles are a landmark? So like-\n- Yeah. So I was describing hand knob earlier. That's a pattern of the\nwrinkles in the brain. It's sort of this sort of Greek letter, omega-shaped area of the brain. - So you could recognize\nthe hand knob area. Like if I show you a thousand brains and give you like one minute with each, you'd be like, \"Yep, that's that?\" - Sure.\n- And so there is some uniqueness to that area of the brain, like in terms of the geometry,\nthe topology of the thing. - Yeah. - Where is it about in the- - So you have this strip of\nbrain running down the top called the primary motor area. And I'm sure you've seen this\npicture of the homunculus laid over the surface of the brain, the weird little guy with\nhuge lips and giant hands. That guy sort of lays with his legs up at the top of the brain and\nface, arm, areas farther down and then some kind of mouth,\nlip, tongue areas farther down. And so the hand is right in there. And then the areas that control speech, at least on the left side of the brain in most people are just below that. And so any muscle that you\nvoluntarily move in your body, the vast majority of that\nreferences that strip or those intentions come\nfrom that strip of brain. And the wrinkle for hand knob is right in the middle of that. - And vision is back here.\n- Back, yep. - Also, close to the surface? - Vision's a little deeper. And so this gets to your question about how deep can you get to do vision. We can't just do the surface of the brain. We have to be able to go in, not as deep as we have to go for DBS, but maybe a centimeter deeper than we're used to for hand insertions. And so that's work in progress. That's a new set of\nchallenges to overcome. - By the way, you\nmentioned the Utah array. And I just saw a picture of that, and that thing looks terrifying. - [Matthew] Yeah, bed of nails. - It's because it's rigid. And then if you look at the\nthreads, they're flexible. What can you say that's interesting to you about the flexible, that kind of approach of the flexible threads to deliver the electrodes\nnext to the neurons? - Yeah, I mean, the goal\nthere comes from experience. I mean, we stand on\nthe shoulders of people that made Utah arrays and\nused Utah arrays for decades before we ever even came along. Neuralink arose, partly this approach to technology arose out\nof a need recognized after Utah arrays would fail routinely because the rigid electrodes, those spikes that are literally hammered using an air hammer into the brain, those spikes generate\na bad immune response that encapsulates the electrode spikes in scar tissue essentially. And so one of the projects\nthat was being worked on in the Andersen lab at\nCaltech when I got there, was to see if you could use chemotherapy to prevent the formation of scar. Things are pretty bad when\nyou're jamming a bed of nails into the brain and then\ntreating that with chemotherapy to try to prevent scar tissue. It's like, maybe we've\ngotten off track here, guys. Maybe there's a fundamental\nredesign necessary. And so Neuralink's approach\nof using highly flexible, tiny electrodes avoids\na lot of the bleeding, avoids a lot of the immune\nresponse that ends up happening when rigid electrodes are\npounded into the brain. And so what we see is\nour electrode longevity and functionality and the\nhealth of the brain tissue immediately surrounding\nthe electrode is excellent. I mean, it goes on for years\nnow in our animal models. - What do most people not understand about the biology of the brain? We mention the vasculature. That's really interesting. - I think the most interesting\nmaybe underappreciated fact is that it really does\ncontrol almost everything. I mean, I don't know, for\nout of the blue example, imagine you want a lever on fertility, you wanna be able to turn\nfertility on and off. I mean, there are legitimate\ntargets in the brain itself to modulate fertility, say blood pressure. You wanna modulate blood pressure. There are legitimate targets\nin the brain for doing that. Things that aren't immediately\nobvious as brain problems are potentially solvable in the brain. And so I think it's an under-explored area for primary treatments of all the things that bother people. - That's a really fascinating\nway to look at it. Like there's a lot of\nconditions we might think have nothing to do with the brain, but they might just be symptoms of something that actually\nstarted in the brain. The actual source of the problem. The primary source is\nsomething in the brain. - Yeah, not always. I mean, kidney disease is real. But there are levers you\ncan pull in the brain that affect all of these systems. - There's knobs.\n- Yeah. - On-off switches and knobs in the brain, from which this all originates. Would you have a Neuralink\nchip implanted in your brain? - Yeah. I think use case right\nnow is use a mouse, right? I can already do that. And so there's no value proposition. On safety grounds alone, sure. I'll do it tomorrow. - You say the use case of the mouse, is it after like researching all this and part of it is just watching\nNoland have so much fun? If you can get that bits per second look really high with a mouse, like being able to interact, 'cause if you think about it, the way, on the smartphone, the way you swipe, that was transformational how\nyou interact with a thing. It's subtle. You don't realize it, but\nto able to touch a phone and to scroll with your\nfinger, that's like, that changed everything. People were sure you\nneed a keyboard to type. There's a lot of HCI aspects to that that changed how we\ninteract with computers. So there could be a certain\nrate of speed with the mouse that would change everything. - Yeah.\n- It's like you might be able to just click around a\nscreen extremely fast. And that, I can see myself getting a Neuralink for much more rapid interaction\nwith the digital devices. - Yeah, I think recording\nspeech intentions from the brain might change things as well. The value proposition\nfor the average person, a keyboard is a pretty\nclunky human interface, requires a lot of training. It's highly variable in\nthe maximum performance that the average person can achieve. I think taking that out of the equation and just having a natural word to computer interface might change things for a lot of people. - It'd be hilarious if that\nis the reason people do it. Even if you have speech to text, that's extremely accurate,\nit currently isn't, but say it gotten super accurate, it'd be hilarious if\npeople went for Neuralink just so you avoid the\nembarrassing aspect of speaking, like looking like a douche bag speaking to your phone in public, which is a real, like that's a real constraint. - Yeah. I mean, with a bone conducting case, that can be an invisible headphone, say, and the ability to think\nwords into software and have it respond to you, that starts to sound sort of like embedded super intelligence. If you can silently ask\nfor the Wikipedia article on any subject and have it read to you, without any observable change happening in the outside world, for one thing, standardized\ntesting is obsolete. (laughs) - Yeah. If it's done well in the\nUX side, it could change. I don't know if it transforms society, but it really can create a kind of shift in the way we interact\nwith digital devices in the way that a smartphone did. Just having to look into the\nsafety of everything involved, I would totally try it\nso it doesn't have to go to some like incredible\nthing where you have, it connects your vision or to some other, like it connects all over your brain. That could be like just\nconnecting to the hand knob. You might have a lot of\ninteresting interaction, human-computer interaction possibilities. That's really interesting. - Yeah, and the technology\non the academic side is progressing at light speed here. I think there was a really\namazing paper out of UC Davis, Sergey Stavisky's lab that\nbasically made a initial solve of speech decode. It was something like 125,000 words that they we're getting with\nvery high accuracy, which is- - So you're just thinking the word? - Yeah.\n- Thinking the word and you're able to get it? - Yeah.\n- Oh boy. Like you have to have the\nintention of speaking it. - Right. - So like do the inner voice. Man, it's so amazing to me\nthat you can do the intention, the signal mapping. All you have to do is just\nimagine yourself doing it. And if you get the feedback\nthat it actually worked, you can get really good at that. Like your brain will first of all adjust and you develop it like any other skill. Like touch typing, you develop\nin that same kind of way. To me, it's just really fascinating to be able to even to play with that. Honestly, like I would get a Neuralink just to be able to play with that. Just to play with the capacity, the capability of my\nmind to learn this skill. It's like learning the skill of typing and learning the skill of moving a mouse. It's another skill of moving the mouse, not with my physical\nbody, but with my mind. - I can't wait to see\nwhat people do with it. I feel like we're cavemen right now. We're like banging rocks with a stick and thinking that we're making music. At some point, when these\nare more widespread, there's gonna be the equivalent of a piano that someone can make art with their brain in a way that we didn't even anticipate. I'm looking forward to it. - Give it to like a teenager. Like anytime I think\nI'm good at something, I'll always go to like, I don't know. Even with the bit per second\nof playing a video game, you realize you give it to a teenager, you've given your link to a teenager, just the large number of them, the kind of stuff, they get good at stuff. They're gonna get like\nhundreds of bits per second. Even just with the current technology. - Probably. Probably. - 'Cause it's also addicting, the number go up aspect of it of like improving and training, 'cause it is almost like a skill. And plus, there's the\nsoftware on the other end that adapts to you. And especially if the\nadapting procedure algorithm becomes better and better and better, you're like learning together. - Yeah, we're scratching the\nsurface on that right now. There's so much more to do. - So on the complete other side of it, you have an RFID chip implanted in you. - Yeah.\n- So I hear, nice. - Little subtle thing. - It's a passive device that you use for unlocking like a\nsafe with top secrets, or what do you use it for? What's the story behind it? - I'm not the first one. There's this whole community\nof weirdo biohackers that have done this stuff, and I think one of the\nearly use cases was storing private crypto wallet keys and whatever. I dabbled in that a bit\nand had some fun with it. - You have some bitcoin\nimplanted in your body somewhere. You can't tell where, yeah. - Yeah, actually, yeah. (Lex laughing) It was the modern day equivalent of finding change in the sofa cushions after I put some orphan crypto on there that I thought was worthless and forgot about it for a few years. Went back and found that some\ncommunity of people loved it and had propped up the value of it. And so it had gone up 50 fold. - Wow.\n- So there was a lot of change in those cushions. (Lex laughing) - That's hilarious. - But the primary use case was mostly as a tech demonstrator. It has my business card on it. You can scan that in by\ntouching it to your phone. It opens the front door to my house, whatever simple stuff. - It's a cool step. It's a cool leap to implant\nsomething in your body. I mean, perhaps, it's a\nsimilar leap to a Neuralink because for a lot of\npeople, that kind of notion of putting something inside\nyour body, something electronic inside a biological system is a big leap. - Yeah, we have a kind\nof a mysticism around the barrier of our skin. We're completely fine\nwith knee replacements, hip replacements, dental implants. But there's a mysticism still around the inviable barrier that\nthe skull represents. And I think that needs to be treated like any other pragmatic barrier. The question isn't, how incredible\nis it to open the skull? The question is, what\nbenefit can we provide? - So from all the surgeries you done, from everything you understand the brain, how much does neuroplasticity\ncome into play? How adaptable is the brain, for example, just even in the case\nof healing from surgery or adapting to the post-surgery situation. - The answer that is sad for me and other people of my demographic is that plasticity decreases with age. Healing decreases with age. I have too much gray hair\nto be optimistic about that. There are theoretical ways\nto increase plasticity using electrical stimulation. Nothing that is totally proven out as a robust enough mechanism\nto offer widely to people. But yeah, I think there's\ncause for optimism that we might find something\nuseful in terms of, say, an implanted electrode\nthat improves learning. Certainly, there's been\nsome really amazing work recently from Nicholas\nSchiff, Jonathan Baker, and others who have a cohort of patients with moderate traumatic brain injury who have had electrodes placed in the deep nucleus in the brain called the centromedian nucleus or just near central media nucleus. And when they apply small\namounts of electricity to that part of the brain, it's almost like electronic caffeine. They're able to improve\npeople's attention and focus. They're able to improve how\nwell people can perform a task. I think in one case, someone\nwho was unable to work after the device was turned on,\nthey were able to get a job. And that's sort of one of the holy grails for me with Neuralink and\nother technologies like this is from a purely utilitarian standpoint, can we make people able\nto take care of themselves and their families economically again? Can we make it so someone\nwho's fully dependent and even maybe requires a\nlot of caregiver resources, can we put them in a position\nto be fully independent, taking care of themselves,\ngiving back to their communities? I think that's a very\ncompelling proposition, and what motivates a lot of what I do and what a lot of the people\nat Neuralink are working for. - It's just a cool possibility that if you put a Neuralink in\nthere, that the brain adapts, like the other part of\nthe brain adapts too. - Yeah.\n- And integrates it. The capacity of the brain to\ndo that is really interesting. Probably unknown to the degree\nto which you can do that, but you're now connecting\nan external thing to it, especially once it's doing stimulation, like the biological brain\nand the electronic brain outside of it working together. Like the possibilities there\nare really interesting. It's still unknown but interesting. It feels like the brain is really good at adapting to whatever. - Yeah.\n- But of course, it is a system that by itself is already, like everything serves a purpose and so you don't wanna\nmess with it too much. - Yeah, it's like, eliminating a species from an ecology. You don't know what the\ndelicate interconnections and dependencies are. The brain is certainly a\ndelicate, complex beast. And we don't know every\npotential downstream consequence of a single change that we make. - Do you see yourself\ndoing, so you mentioned P1, surgeries of P2, P3, P4, P5? Just more and more and more humans. - I think it's a certain\nkind of brittleness or a failure on the company's side if we need me to do all the surgeries. I think something that I would very much like to work towards is a\nprocess that is so simple and so robust on the surgery side that literally anyone could do it. We wanna get away from\nrequiring intense expertise or intense experience to\nhave this successfully done and make it as simple and\ntranslatable as possible. I mean, I would love it if\nevery neurosurgeon on the planet had no problem doing this. I think we're probably far\nfrom a regulatory environment that would allow people\nthat aren't neurosurgeons to do this, but not impossible. - All right, I'll sign up for that. Did you ever anthropomorphize\nthe robot R1? Like do you give it a name? Do you see it as like a friend, as like working together with you? - I mean, to a certain degree it's- - Or anatomy who's gonna get the gap. - To a certain degree, yeah,\nit's complex relationship. - All the good relationships are. - It's funny when, in the\nmiddle of the surgery, there's a part of it where I stand basically shoulder to\nshoulder with the robot. And so if you're in the room\nreading the body language, that's my brother in arms there. We're working together\non the same problem. Yeah, I'm not threatened by it. - Keep telling yourself that. (laughs) How have all the surgeries that\nyou've done over the years, the people you've helped and the stakes, the high stakes that you've mentioned, how has that changed your\nunderstanding of life and death? - Yeah. It gives you a very visceral sense, and this makes sound trite, but it gives you a very visceral sense that death is inevitable. On one hand, you are, as a neurosurgeon, you're deeply involved in these like just hard to fathom tragedies: young parents dying, leaving\na four-year-old behind say. And on the other hand, it takes the sting out of it a bit because you see how just mind\nnumbingly universal death is. There's zero chance that\nI'm going to avoid it. I know techno optimists right now and longevity buffs right now would disagree on that 0.0% estimate. But I don't see any chance that our generation is going to avoid it. Entropy is a powerful force, and we are very ornate,\ndelicate, brittle DNA machines that aren't up to the\ncosmic ray bombardment that we're subjected to. So on the one hand, every human that has ever\nlived died or will die. On the other hand, it's just\none of the hardest things to imagine inflicting on anyone that you love is having them gone. I'm sure you've had friends\nthat aren't living anymore and it's hard to even think about them. And so I wish I had arrived\nat the point of nirvana where death doesn't have a sting. I'm not worried about it,\nbut I can at least say that I'm comfortable\nwith the certainty of it. If not, having found out how\nto take the tragedy out of it when I think about my\nkids either not having me or me not having them or my wife. - Maybe I have come to accepting intellectual certainty of\nit, but it may be the pain that comes with losing\nthe people you love, I don't think I've come to understand the existential aspect of it. Like that this is gonna end. And I don't mean like in some trite way. I mean like, it certainly feels\nlike it's not going to end. Like you live life like\nit's not going to end. - [Matthew] Right. - And the fact that this light that's shining this consciousness is going to no longer be,\nin one moment, maybe today, it fills me when I really am able to load all that in with\nErnest Becker's terror. Like it's a real fear. I think people aren't always honest with how terrifying it is. I think the more you are able to really think through it,\nthe more terrifying it is. It's not such a simple thing. Oh well, it's the way life is. If you really can load that in, it's hard. But I think that's why the stoics did it, because it like helps you\nget your shit together and be like, well, the moment, every single moment you're\nalive is just beautiful. And it's terrifying that it's gonna end, like almost like you're\nshivering in the cold a child helpless, this kind of feeling. And then it makes you,\nwhen you have warmth, when you have the safety, when you have the love\nto really appreciate it. I feel like sometimes, in your position, when you mentioned\narmor, just to see death, it might make you not be able to see that, the finiteness of life, because if you kept looking\nat that, it might break you. So it's good to know that you're kind of still struggling with that, that there's the neurosurgeon\nand then there's a human. And the human is still\nable to struggle with that and feel the fear of that\nand the pain of that. - Yeah, it definitely\nmakes you ask the question of how long, how many\nof these can you see? And not say, \"I can't do this anymore.\" But I mean, you said it well. I think it gives you an\nopportunity to just appreciate that you're alive today. And I've got three kids\nand an amazing wife and I'm really happy. Things are good. I get to help on a project\nthat I think matters. I think it moves us forward. I'm a very lucky person. - It's the early steps of a potentially gigantic leap for humanity. It's a really interesting one. And it's cool 'cause like you, you read about all this stuff in history where it's like the early days. I've been reading, before\ngoing to the Amazon, I would read about explorers\nthat would go and explore even the Amazon jungle for the first time. Those are the early steps. Or early steps into space, early steps in any discipline, in physics and mathematics. And it's cool 'cause this\nis like, on the grand scale, these are the early steps into delving deep into the human brain. So not just observing the brain, but be able to interact\nwith the human brain. It's gonna help a lot of people, but it also might help us understand what the hell's going on in there. - Yeah, I think ultimately,\nwe wanna give people more levers that they can pull, right? Like you wanna give people options. If you can give someone\na dial that they can turn on how happy they are, I think that makes people\nreally uncomfortable. But now, talk about major\ndepressive disorder. Talk about people that\nare committing suicide at an alarming rate in this country. And try to justify that queasiness in that light of you\ncan give people a knob to take away suicidal\nideation, suicidal intention. I would give them that knob. I don't know how you\njustify not doing that. - Yeah, you can think about like all the suffering that's\ngoing on in the world. Like every single human being that's suffering right now, it'll be a glowing red dot. The more suffering, the more it's glowing. And you just see the\nmap of human suffering, and any technology that\nallows you to dim that light of suffering on a grand\nscale is pretty exciting, because there's a lot of people suffering and most of them suffer quietly. We look away too often, and we should remember\nthose that are suffering, 'cause once again, most of\nthem are suffering quietly. - Well, and on a grander\nscale, the fabric of society, people have a lot of complaints about how our social fabric is working or not working, how our politics\nis working or not working. Those things are made\nof neurochemistry too, in aggregate, right? Like our politics is\ncomposed of individuals with human brains and, the\nway it works or doesn't work is potentially tunable in\nthe sense that, I don't know, say remove our addictive behaviors or tune our addictive\nbehaviors for social media or our addiction to outrage,\nour addiction to sharing the most angry political\ntweet we can find. I don't think that leads\nto a functional society. And if you had options for people to moderate\nthat maladaptive behavior, there could be huge benefits to society. Maybe we could all work together a little more harmoniously\ntoward useful ends. - There's a sweet spot,\nlike you mentioned, you don't wanna completely\nremove all the dark sides of human nature 'cause those\nkind of are somehow necessary to make the whole thing work. But there's a sweet spot. - Yeah, I agree. We gotta suffer a little, just not so much that you lose hope. - Yeah. We knew all the surgeries you've done. Have you seen consciousness in there ever? Was there like a glowing light? - I have this sense that I never found it. Never removed it, like a\ndementor in Harry Potter. I have this sense that\nconsciousness is a lot less magical than our instincts wanna claim it is. It seems to me like a useful\nanalog for thinking about what consciousness is in the brain, is that we have a really\ngood intuitive understanding of what it means to, say, touch your skin and know what's being touched. I think consciousness is just that level of sensory mapping applied to the thought processes\nin the brain itself. So what I'm saying is consciousness is the sensation of some part\nof your brain being active. So you feel it working. You feel the part of your brain that thinks of red things\nor winged creatures or the taste of coffee. You feel those parts of\nyour brain being active the way that I'm feeling my\npalm being touched, right? And that sensory system\nthat feels the brain working is consciousness. - That's so brilliant. It's the same way, it's\nthe sensation of touch when you're touching a thing. Consciousness is the sensation of you feeling your brain working,\nyour brain thinking, your brain perceiving. - Which isn't like a\nwarping of space and time or some quantum field effect, right? It's nothing magical. People always wanna\nascribe to consciousness something truly different. And there's this awesome long history of people looking at whatever the latest discovery in physics is\nto explain consciousness, because it's the most magical, the most out there thing\nthat you can think of. And people always wanna do\nthat with consciousness. I don't think that's necessary. It's just a very useful and gratifying way of\nfeeling your brain work. - And as we said, it's\none heck of a brain. - [Matthew] Yeah. - Everything we see around\nus, everything we love, everything that's beautiful, it came from brains like these. - It's all electrical activity\nhappening inside your skull. - And I, for one, am grateful\nthat there's people like you that are exploring all\nthe ways that it works and all the ways it can be made better. - Thanks, Lex. - Thank you so much for talking today. - It's been a joy. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew MacDougall. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Bliss Chapman, Brain Interface Software\nlead at Neuralink. You told me that you've\nmet hundreds of people with spinal cord injuries or with ALS and that your motivation\nfor helping at Neuralink is grounded in wanting to help them. Can you describe this motivation? - Yeah. First, just a thank you to all the people I've gotten a chance to speak with, for sharing their stories with me. I don't think there's any\nworld really in which I can share their stories as\npowerful way as they can. But just I think to summarize\nat a very high level what I hear over and over\nagain is that people with ALS or severe spinal cord injury in a place where they basically can't\nmove physically anymore, really at the end of the day\nare looking for independence. And that can mean different\nthings for different people. For some folks, it can mean\nthe ability just to be able to communicate again\nindependently without needing to wear something on their face,\nwithout needing a caretaker to be able to put\nsomething in their mouth. For some folks, it can mean\nindependence to be able to work again, to be able to\nnavigate a computer digitally, efficiently enough to\nbe able to get a job, to be able to support themself,\nto be able to move out and ultimately be able to support themself after their family maybe\nisn't there anymore to take care of them. And for some folks, it's as simple as just being able to respond\nto their kid in time before they run away or get\ninterested in something else. And these are deeply personal and sort of very human problems. And what strikes me again and again when talking with these folks is that this is actually an engineering problem. This is a problem that\nwith the right resources, with the right team, we can\nmake a lot of progress on. And at the end of the day, I think that's a deeply inspiring message and something that makes me\nexcited to get up every day. - So it's both an engineering problem in terms of a BCI, for example, that can give them capabilities where they can interact with the world. But also on the other side,\nit's an engineering problem for the rest of the world\nto make it more accessible for people living with quadriplegia. - Yeah, and actually,\nI'll take a broad view sort of lens on this for a second. I think I'm very in favor of anyone working in this problem space. So beyond BCI, I'm happy and excited and willing to support any way I can folks working on eye tracking systems, working on speech to text systems, working on head trackers or\nmouse sticks or quad sticks. And I've met many engineers and folks in the community\nthat do exactly those things. And I think for the people\nwe're trying to help, it doesn't matter what the\ncomplexity of the solution is as long as the problem is solved. And I wanna emphasize that there can be many solutions out there that can help with these problems. And BCI is one of a\ncollection of such solutions. So BCI, in particular, I think offers several advantages here. And I think the folks that\nrecognize this immediately are usually the people who\nhave spinal cord injury or some form of paralysis. Usually, you don't have to explain to them why this might be something\nthat could be helpful. It's usually pretty self-evident. But for the rest of us\nfolks that don't live with severe spinal cord injury or who don't know somebody with ALS, it's not often obvious why\nyou would want a brain implant to be able to connect\nand navigate a computer. And it's surprisingly nuanced, and to the degree that\nI've learned a huge amount just working with Noland in the first Neuralink clinical trial\nand understanding from him in his words why this\ndevice is impactful for him. And it's a nuanced topic. It can be the case that\neven if you can achieve the same thing, for\nexample, with a mouse stick when navigating a computer,\nhe doesn't have access to that mouse stick every\nsingle minute of the day. He only has access when\nsomeone's available to put it in front of him. And so a BCI can really offer a level of independence and autonomy that if it wasn't literally\nphysically part of your body, it'd be hard to achieve in any other way. - So there's a lot of fascinating aspects to what it takes to get Noland to be able to control a cursor on\nthe screen with his mind. You texted me something that I just love. You said, \"I was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1. I was in the operating room during the first human surgery monitoring live signals\ncoming out of the brain. I work with the user basically every day to develop new UX paradigm's\ndecoding strategies. And I was part of the\nteam that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded.\" We'll talk about I think\nevery aspect of that, but just zooming out, what was it like to be part of that team\nand part of that historic, I would say, historic first? - Yeah, I think for me, this is something I've been excited about for close to 10 years now. And so to be able to be\neven just some small part of making it a reality\nis extremely exciting. A couple maybe special moments\nduring that whole process that I'll never really truly forget, one of them is during the actual surgery, at that point in time, I\nknow Noland quite well. I know his family. And so I think the initial\nreaction when Noland is rolled into the operating room is just a \"oh shit\" kind of reaction. But at that point, muscle memory kicks in and you sort of go into, you let your body just do all the talking. And I have the lucky job in\nthat particular procedure to just be in charge of\nmonitoring the implant. So my job is to sit there, to look at the signals\ncoming off the implant, to look at the live brain\ndata streaming off the device as threads are being\ninserted into the brain and just to basically observe and make sure that nothing is going wrong or that there's no red\nflags or fault conditions that we need to go and investigate or pause the surgery to debug. And because I had that\nsort of spectator view of the surgery, I had a\nslightly removed perspective than I think most folks in the room. I got to sit there and think to myself, \"Wow, that brain is moving a lot.\" When you look into the\nside look craniectomy, that we stick the threads in, one thing that most people don't\nrealize is the brain moves. The brain moves a lot when you breathe, when your heart beats, and\nyou can see it visibly. So that's something that I\nthink was a surprise to me and very, very exciting to be\nable to see someone's brain who you physically know and\nhave talked with at length actually pulsing and\nmoving inside their skull. - And they use that brain\nto talk to you previously, and now it's right there moving. - Yep.\n- Actually, I didn't realize that in terms of the thread sending, so the Neuralink implant\nis active during surgery, and one thread at a time, you're able to start seeing the signal? - Yeah.\n- So that's part of the way you test that the thing is working? - Yeah, so actually in the operating room, right after we sort of finished\nall the thread insertions, I started collecting what's\ncalled broadband data. So broadband is basically\nthe most raw form of signal you can collect\nfrom a Neuralink electrode. It's essentially a measurement of the local field potential or the, yeah, the voltage essentially measured by that electrode. And we have a certain\nmode in our application that allows us to visualize\nwhere detected spikes are. So it visualizes sort of where, in the broadband symbol, and it's very, very raw form of the data a neuron is actually spiking. And so one of these moments\nthat I'll never forget as part of this whole clinical trial is seeing live in the operating room, while he's still under anesthesia, beautiful spikes being\nshown in the application, just streaming live to a\ndevice I'm holding in my hand. - So this is no signal\nprocessing the raw data and then the signals\nprocessings on top of it, you're seeing the spikes detected? - [Bliss] Right, yeah. - And that's a UX too because-\n- Yes. - That looks beautiful as well. - During that procedure, there was actually a lot\nof cameramen in the room. So they also were curious\nand wanted to see. There's several neurosurgeons in the room who are all just excited to\nsee robots taking their job and they're all crowded\naround a small little iPhone watching this live brain\ndata stream out of his brain. - What was that like seeing the robot do some of the surgery? So the computer vision\naspect where it detects all the spots that avoid the blood vessels and then obviously with\nthe human supervision, then actually doing the\nreally high precision connection of the threads to the brain. - That's a good question. My answer's gonna be pretty\nlame here, but it was boring. I've seen it so many times. Yeah, that's exactly how\nyou want surgery to be. You want it to be boring, because I've seen it so many times. I've seen the robot do the surgery literally hundreds of times, and so it was just one more time. - Yeah, all the practice\nsurgeries and the proxies and this is just another day. - Yep. - So what about when Noland woke up? Do you remember a moment where he was able to move the\ncursor, not move the cursor, but get signal from the brain such that it was able to show\nthat there's a connection? - Yeah, yeah. So we are quite excited to\nmove as quickly as we can, and Noland was really, really\nexcited to get started. He wanted to get started\nactually the day of surgery, but we waited till the next\nmorning very patiently. So a long night. And the next morning in the\nICU, where he was recovering, he wanted to get started and\nactually start to understand what kind of signal we can\nmeasure from his brain. And maybe for folks who are not familiar with the Neuralink system, we\nimplant the Neuralink system or the Neuralink implant\nin the motor cortex. So the motor cortex is responsible for representing things like motor intent, sort of if you imagine\nclosing and opening your hand, that kind of signal representation would be present in the motor cortex. If you imagine moving\nyour arm back and forth or wiggling a pinky, this sort of signal can be present in the motor cortex. So one of the ways we\nstart to sort of map out, what kind of signal do we\nactually have access to in any particular individual's brain is through this task called body mapping. And body mapping is where\nyou essentially present a visual to the user and you say, \"Hey, imagine doing this.\" And that visual is a 3D\nhand opening and closing, or index finger modulating up and down. And you ask the user to imagine that, and obviously, you can't see them do this, 'cause they're paralyzed\nso you can't see them actually move their arm,\nbut while they do this task, you can record neural activity, and you can basically\noffline model and check, can I predict or can I\ndetect the modulation corresponding with\nthose different actions? And so we did that task and we realized, hey, there's actually some modulation associated with some of his hand motion, which was the first indication that, okay, we can potentially use that modulation to do useful things in the world. For example, control a computer cursor. And he started playing with it, the first time we showed him it, and we actually just\ntook the same live view of his brain activity and\nput it in front of him. And we said, \"Hey, you\ntell us what's going on. We're not you. You're able to imagine different things, and we know that it's\nmodulating some of these neurons so you figure out for us what that is actually representing.\" And so he played with it for a bit. He was like, \"I don't quite get it yet.\" He played for a bit longer. And he said, \"Oh, when I move this finger, I see this particular\nneuron start to fire more.\" And I said, okay, \"Prove it, do it again.\" And so he said, \"Okay,\nthree, two, one, boom.\" And the minute he moved, you\ncan see like instantaneously this neuron is firing - single neuron. I can tell you the exact channel number if you're interested. It's stuck in my brain now forever. But that single channel firing\nwas a beautiful indication that it was behaved really\nmodulated neural activity that could then be used\nfor downstream tasks like decoding a computer cursor. - And when you say single channel, is that associated with\na single electrode? - Yeah, channel electrode\nare interchangeable. - And there's 1,024 of those? - 1,024, yeah. - That's incredible that that works. When I was learning about all\nthis and like loading it in, it was just blowing my\nmind that the intention, you can visualize yourself\nmoving the finger, that can turn into a signal, and the fact that you\ncan then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving or have the intention of the cursor moving and that leading to a signal that can then be used to move the cursor, there is so many exciting things there to learn about the brain,\nabout the way the brain works, the very fact of their existing signal that can be used is really powerful. But it feels like that's\njust like the beginning of figuring out how that\nsignal could be used really, really effectively. I should also just, there's so many fascinating details here, but you mentioned the body mapping step. At least in the version I saw\nthat Noland was showing off, there's like a super nice interface, like a graphical interface. But like it just felt like\nI was like in the future 'cause it like, you know, I guess it visualizes you moving the hand. And there's very like a\nsexy, polished interface. Hello. I don't know if there's a voice component, but it just felt like when you wake up in a really nice video\ngame and this is a tutorial at the beginning of that video game. \"This is what you're supposed to do.\" It's cool. - No, I mean, the future\nshould feel like the future. - But it's not easy to pull that off. I mean, it needs to be\nsimple but not too simple. - Yeah, and I think the\nUX design component here is underrated for BCI\ndevelopment in general. There's a whole interaction effect between the ways in which you visualize an instruction to the user and the kinds of signal you can get back. And that quality of sort of\nyour behavioral alignment to the neural signal is a function of how good you are at expressing to the user what you want them to do. And so yeah, we spend a lot\nof time thinking about the UX, of how we build our applications, of how the decoder actually functions, the control surfaces it\nprovides to the user. All these little details matter a lot. - So maybe it'd be nice to get\ninto a little bit more detail of what the signal looks like and what the decoding looks like. So there's a N1 implant\nthat has, like we mentioned, 1,024 electrodes and that's\ncollecting raw data, raw signal. What does that signal look like, and what are the different\nsteps along the way before it's transmitted,\nand what is transmitted, all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, yep. This is gonna be a fun one. Let's go. So maybe before diving into what we do, it's worth understanding\nwhat we're trying to measure, because that dictates a\nlot of the requirements for the system that we build. And what we're trying to measure is really individual neurons\nproducing action potentials. And action potential\nis, you can think of it like a little electrical impulse that you can detect if\nyou're close enough. And by being close enough,\nI mean, like within let's say 100 microns of that cell. And 100 microns is a\nvery, very tiny distance. And so the number of neurons\nthat you're gonna pick up with any given electrode is just a small radius\naround that electrode. And the other thing worth understanding about the underlying biology here is that when neurons\nproduce an action potential, the width of that action potential\nis about one millisecond. So from the start of the\nspike to the end of the spike, that whole width of that sort\nof characteristic feature of a neuron firing is\none millisecond wide. And if you want to detect\nthat an individual spike is occurring or not, you\nneed to sample that signal or sample the local full\npotential nearby that neuron much more frequently\nthan once a millisecond. You need to sample many,\nmany times per millisecond to be able to detect that this is actually the characteristic waveform of a neuron producing an action potential. And so we sample across\nall 1,024 electrodes about 20,000 times a second. 20,000 times a second means we've already given\none millisecond window. We have about 20 samples that tell us what that exact shape of that\naction potential looks like. And once we've sort of\nsampled at super high rate the underlying electrical\nfield nearby these cells, we can process that signal into just where do we detect a\nspike or where do we not, sort of a binary signal one or zero. Do we detect a spike in\nthis one millisecond or not? And we do that because the\nactual information carrying sort of subspace of neural activity is just when are spikes occurring. Essentially, everything that we care about for decoding can be\ncaptured or represented in the frequency\ncharacteristics of spike trains, meaning how often are spikes firing in any given window of time. And so that allows us to\ndo sort of a crazy amount of compression from this very\nrich, high density signal to something that's much, much more sparse and compressible that can be\nsent out over a wireless radio, like a Bluetooth\ncommunication, for example. - Quick tangents here. You mentioned electrode neuron. There's a local neighborhood\nof neurons nearby. How difficult is it to like isolate from where the spike came from? - Yeah, so there's a whole\nfield of sort of academic neuroscience work on exactly this problem, of basically given a single electrode or given a set of electrodes\nmeasuring a set of neurons, how can you sort of sort, spike sort which spikes are\ncoming from what neuron? And this is a problem that's\npursued in academic work because you care about it for\nunderstanding what's going on in the underlying sort of\nneuroscience of the brain. If you care about understanding how the brain's representing information, how that's evolving through time, then that's a very, very\nimportant question to understand. For sort of the\nengineering side of things, at least at the current scale, if the number of neurons per\nelectrode is relatively small, you can get away with basically ignoring that problem completely. You can think of it like\nsort of a random projection of neurons to electrodes, and there may be in some cases more than one neuron per electrode. But if that number is small enough, those signals can be thought of as sort of a union of the two. And for many applications,\nthat's a totally reasonable trade off to make and can\nsimplify the problem a lot. And as you sort of\nscale out channel count, the relevance of distinguishing\nindividual neurons becomes less important, because\nyou have more overall signal and you can start to rely\non sort of correlations or covariance structure in\nthe data to help understand when that channel's firing, what does that actually represent? 'Cause you know that when\nthat channel's firing in concert with these other 50 channels, that means move left. But when that same channel's\nfiring with concert with these other 10 channels,\nthat means move right. - Okay, so you have to do\nthis kind of spike detection on board, and you have to\ndo that super efficiently, so fast and not use too much power, 'cause you don't wanna be\ngenerating too much heat. So it has to be a super\nsimple signal processing step. - [Bliss] Yeah. - Is there some wisdom you can share about what it takes to overcome that challenge? - Yeah, so we've tried\nmany different versions of basically turning this raw signal into sort of a feature that you\nmight wanna send off the device. And I'll say that I don't think we're at the final step of this process. This is a long journey. We have something that\nworks clearly today, but there can be many\napproaches that we find in the future that are much better than what we do right now. So some versions of what we do right now, and there's a lot of academic\nheritage to these ideas, so I don't wanna claim\nthat these are original Neuralink ideas or anything like that. But one of these ideas\nis basically to build a sort of like a convolutional\nfilter almost, if you will, that slides across the signal and looks for a certain\ntemplate to be matched. And that template consists\nof sort of how deep the spike modulates, how much it recovers, and what the duration\nand window of time is that the whole process takes. And if you can see in the\nsignal that that template is matched within certain bounds, then you can say, \"Okay, that's a spike.\" One reason that approach\nis super convenient is that you can actually implement that extremely efficiently in hardware, which means that you\ncan run it in low power across 1,024 channels all at once. Another approach that we've\nrecently started exploring, and this can be combined with\nthe spike detection approach, something called spike band power. And the benefits of that approach are that you may be able to\npick up some signal from neurons that are maybe too far away\nto be detected as a spike, because the farther away\nyou are from an electrode, the weaker that actual spike waveform will look like on that electrode. So you might be able to pick up population level activity\nof things that are maybe slightly outside the\nnormal recording radius, what neuroscientists\nsometimes refer to as the hash of activity, the other\nstuff that's going on, and you can look at sort\nof across many channels how that sort of background\nnoise is behaving and you might be able to get more juice out of the signal that way. But it comes at a cost. That signal is now a floating\npoint representation, which means it's more expensive\nto send out over a power. It means you have to find\ndifferent ways to compress it that are different than what you can apply to binary signals. So there's a lot of different challenges associated with these\ndifferent modalities. - So also, in terms of communication, you're limited by the\namount of data you can send. - [Bliss] Yeah. - And also, because you're currently using the Bluetooth protocol, you\nhave to batch stuff together. But you have to also do this\nkeeping the latency crazy low. Like crazy low. Anything to say about the latency? - Yeah, this is a passion project of mine, so I wanna build the\nbest mouse in the world. I don't wanna build like the, you know, the Chevrolet Spark or\nwhatever of electric cars. I wanna build like the Tesla\nRoadster version of a mouse. And I really do think it's quite possible that within 5 to 10 years, that most eSports\ncompetitions are dominated by people with paralysis. This is like a very real\npossibility for number of reasons. One is that they'll have\naccess to the best technology to play video games effectively. The second is they have the time to do so. So those two factors together are particularly potent\nfor eSport competitors. - Unless people without paralysis are also allowed to implant. - (laughs) Right. - Which is, it is another way to interact with a digital device. And there's something to that, if it's a fundamentally\ndifferent experience, more efficient experience. Even if it's not like some kinda full on high bandwidth communication, if it's just the ability to\nmove the mouse 10x faster, like the bits per second, if I can achieve a bits per second, that 10x, what I can do with the mouse, that's a really interesting\npossibility of what that can do, especially as you get really\ngood at it with training. - It's definitely the case that you have a higher\nceiling performance, because you don't have\nto buffer your intention through your arm, through your muscle. You get just, by nature of\nhaving a brain implant at all, like 75 millisecond\nlead time on any action that you're actually trying to take. And there's some nuance to this, like there's evidence\nthat the motor cortex, you can sort of plan\nout sequences of action so you may not get that\nwhole benefit all the time. But for sort of like\nreaction time style games where you just wanna, somebody's over here, snipe\n'em, that kind of thing. You actually do have just\nan inherent advantage 'cause you don't need\nto go through muscle. So the question is, just how\nmuch faster can you make it? And we're already than\nyou what you would do if you're going through muscle\nfrom a latency point of view, and we're in the early stage of that. I think we can push it\nsort of our end-to-end latency right now from brain\nspike to cursor movement, it's about 22 milliseconds. If you think about the\nbest mice in the world, the best gaming mice, that's\nabout five milliseconds-ish of latency, depending on how you measure. Depending how fast your screen refreshes, there's a lot of characteristics\nthat matter there. But yeah, and the rough\ntime for like a neuron in the brain to actually impact your command of your hand\nis about 75 millisecond. So if you look at those numbers, you can see that we're\nalready like competitive and slightly faster than what you'd get by actually moving your hand. And this is something that,\nif you ask Noland about it, when he moved the cursor\nfor the first time, we asked him about this. This was something I\nwas super curious about, like what does it feel like\nwhen you're modulating, a click intention or when\nyou're trying to just move the cursor to the right. He said it moves before he is\nlike actually intending it to, which is kind of a surreal\nthing and something that I would love to experience myself one day. What is that like to have that\nthing just be so immediate, so fluid that it feels like it's happening before you're actually\nintending it to move. - Yeah, I suppose we've\ngotten used to that latency, that natural latency that happens. So is the currently the\nbottleneck, the communication, so like the Bluetooth communication, what's the actual bottleneck? I mean, there's always\ngonna be a bottleneck. What's the current bottleneck? - Yeah, a couple things. So kind of hilariously,\nBluetooth low energy protocol has some restrictions on how\nfast you can communicate. So the protocol itself\nestablishes a standard of the most frequent sort\nof updates you can send are on the order of 7.5 milliseconds. And as we push latency down to the level of sort of individual\nspikes impacting control, that level of resolution,\nthat kind of protocol is gonna become a limiting\nfactor at some scale. Another sort of important nuance to this is that it's not just the Neuralink itself that's part of this equation. If you start pushing latency\nsort of below the level of how fast screens refresh,\nthen you have another problem. Like you need your whole system\nto be able to be as reactive as the sort of limits of what\nthe technology can offer. Like you need the screen like 120 hertz just doesn't work anymore if you're trying to have something respond at something that's at the\nlevel of one millisecond. - That's a really cool challenge. I also like that for a T-shirt, the best mouse in the world. Tell me on the receiving\nend, so the decoding step, now we figured out what the spikes are, we got them all together, now we're sending that over to the app. What's the decoding step look like? - Yeah, so maybe first, what is decoding? I think there's probably\na lot of folks listening that just have no clue what it means to decode brain activity. - Actually, even if we\nzoom out beyond that, what is the app? So there's an implant that's\nwirelessly communicating with any digital device\nthat has an app installed. So maybe can you tell me a\nhigh level what the app is, what the software is outside of the brain? - Yeah, so maybe working\nbackwards from the goal, the goal is to help\nsomeone with paralysis, in this case Noland, be able to navigate his\ncomputer independently. And we think the best way to do that is to offer them the\nsame tools that we have to navigate our software\nbecause we don't wanna have to rebuild an entire software\necosystem for the brain. At least not yet. Maybe someday you can imagine there's UXs that are built natively for BCI. But in terms of what's\nuseful for people today, I think most people would prefer\nto be able to just control mouse and keyboard inputs\nto all the applications that they wanna use for their daily jobs, for communicating with\ntheir friends, et cetera. And so the job of the application is really to translate\nthis wireless stream of brain data coming off the implant into control of the computer. And we do that by essentially building a mapping from brain activity\nto sort of the HID inputs to the actual hardware. So HID is just the protocol for communicating like\ninput device events. So for example, move\nmouse to this position or press this key down. And so that mapping is fundamentally what the app is responsible for. But there's a lot of nuance\nof how that mapping works that we spend a lot of\ntime to try to get right and we're still in the early\nstages of a long journey to figure out how to do that optimally. So one part of that process is decoding. So decoding is this process of taking the statistical\npatterns of brain data that's being channeled across\nthis Bluetooth connection to the application and turning it into, for example, a mouse movement. And that decoding step,\nyou can think of it in a couple different parts. So similar to any\nmachine learning problem, there's a training step and\nthere's an inference step. The training step in our\ncase is a very intricate behavioral process where the user has to imagine doing different actions. So for example, they'll\nbe presented a screen with a cursor on it and they'll be asked to push that cursor to the right. Then imagine pushing that\ncursor to the left, push it up, push it down, and we can\nbasically build up a pattern or using any sort of modern ML method, a mapping of given this brain data and that imagined behavior\nmap one to the other. And then at test time, you take that same\npattern matching system. In our case, it's a deep neural network, and you run it and you\ntake the live stream of brain data coming off\ntheir implant, you decode it by pattern matching to what\nyou saw at calibration time, and you use that for a\ncontrol of the computer. Now, a couple like sort of rabbit holes that are I think are quite interesting, one of them has to do with how you build that best template matching system because there's a variety\nof behavioral challenges and also debugging challenges when you're working with\nsomeone who's paralyzed. Because again, fundamentally, you don't observe what\nthey're trying to do. You can't see them attempt\nto move their hand. And so you have to figure out\na way to instruct the user to do something and validate\nthat they're doing it correctly such that then you can\ndownstream, build with confidence the mapping between the neural spikes and the intended action. And by doing the action correctly, what I really mean is at\nthis level of resolution of what neurons are doing. So if in ideal world,\nyou could get a signal of behavioral intent that\nis ground truth accurate at the scale of sort of\none millisecond resolution, then with high confidence,\nI could build a mapping from my neuro spikes to\nthat behavioral intention. But the challenge is, again, that you don't observe what\nthey're actually doing. And so there's a lot of nuance to how you build user experiences that give you more than\njust sort of a course on average correct representation of what the user's intending to do. If you want to build\nthe world's best mouse, you really want it to be\nas responsive as possible. You want it to be able to do exactly what the user's intending\nat every sort of step along the way, not just\non average be correct when you're trying to move\nit from left to right. And building a behavioral\nsort of calibration game or sort of software experience\nthat gives you that level of resolution is what we\nspend a lot of time working. - So the calibration process, the interface has to encourage precision, meaning like whatever it does, it should be super intuitive\nthat the next thing the human is going to likely\ndo is exactly that intention that you need and only that intention. And you don't have any feedback except that may be\nspeaking to you afterwards what they actually did. You can't, \"Oh yeah.\"\n- Right. - So that's fundamentally, that is a really exciting UX challenge, 'cause that's all on the UX. It's not just about being\nfriendly or nice or usable. - Yeah.\n- It's like- - User experience is how it works. - It's how it works.\n- Yeah. - For the calibration, and calibration, at least\nat this stage of Neuralink, is like fundamental to\nthe operation of the thing and not just calibration but continued calibration essentially. - [Bliss] Yeah. - Wow, yeah.\n- You said something that I think is worth\nexploring there a little bit. You said it's primarily a UX challenge, and I think a large component of it is, but there is also a very interesting machine learning challenge here, which is given some data set, including some on average correct behavior of asking the user to\nmove up or move down, move right, move left, and given a data set of neural spikes, is there a way to infer in\nsome kind of semi-supervised or entirely unsupervised way what that high resolution\nversion of their intention is? And if you think about\nit, like there probably is because there are enough\ndata points in the dataset, enough constraints on your\nmodel that there should be a way with the right sort of formulation to let the model figure out itself. For example, at this millisecond, this is exactly how hard\nthey're pushing upwards. And at this millisecond, this is how hard they're trying to push upwards. - It's really important to\nhave very clean labels, yes. So like the problem becomes much harder from the machine learning perspective if the labels are noisy. - [Bliss] That's correct. - And then to get the clean\nlabels, that's a UX challenge. - Correct, although clean labels, I think maybe it's worth\nexploring what that exactly means. I think any given labeling strategy will have some number\nof assumptions it makes about what the user's attempting to do. Those assumptions can be\nformulated in a loss function, or they can be formulated\nin terms of heuristics that you might use to just try to estimate or guesstimate what the\nuser's trying to do. And what really matters is how accurate are those assumptions. For example, you might say, \"Hey, user, push upwards and follow the speed of this cursor,\" and your heuristic might be\nthat they're trying to do it exactly what that cursor's trying to do. Another competing heuristic might be they're actually trying\nto go slightly faster at the beginning of the movement and slightly slower at the end. And those competing heuristics\nmay or may not be accurate reflections of what the\nuser's trying to do. Another version of the task might be, \"Hey, user, imagine moving\nthis cursor a fixed offset. So rather than follow the cursor, just try to move it exactly\n200 pixels to the right.\" So here's the cursor, here's the target. Okay, cursor disappears. Try to move that now invisible cursor 200 pixels to the right. And the assumption in that\ncase would be that the user can actually modulate\ncorrectly that position offset, but that position offset assumption might be a weaker\nassumption, and therefore, potentially you can make it more accurate than these heuristics that\nare trying to guesstimate at each millisecond what\nthe user's trying to do. So you can imagine different tasks that make different\nassumptions about the nature of the user intention and\nthose assumptions being correct is what I would think of as a clean label. - For that step, what are we\nsupposed to be visualizing? There's a cursor and you\nwanna move that cursor to the right or the left or up and down or maybe move them by a certain offset. So that's one way, is that the\nbest way to do calibration? So for example, an alternative crazy way that probably is playing a role here is a game like Webgrid, where you're just getting a\nvery large amount of data, the person playing a game, where if they're in a state of flow, maybe you can get clean\nsignal as a side effect. - [Bliss] Yep. - Is that not an effective\nway for initial calibration? - Yeah, great question. There's a lot to unpack there. So the first thing I\nwould draw a distinction between a sort of open\nloop, first closed loop. So open loop, what I mean by that is the user is sort of\ngoing from zero to one. They have no model at all, and they're trying to get to the place where they have some\nlevel of control at all. In that setup, you really\nneed to have some task that gives the user a hint\nof what you want them to do such that you can build this mapping again from brain data to output. Then once they have a model,\nyou could imagine them using that model and\nactually adapting to it and figuring out the right\nway to use it themself and then retraining on that data to give you sort of a\nboost in performance. There's a lot of challenges associated with both of these techniques\nand we can sort of rabbit hole into both of 'em, if you're interested. But the sort of challenge\nwith the open loop task is that the user themself doesn't get proprioceptive feedback\nabout what they're doing. They don't necessarily perceive themself or feel the mouse under their hand when they're using an open, when they're trying to do\nan open loop calibration. They're being asked to perform something. Like imagine if you sort of\nhad your whole right arm numbed and you stuck it in a box\nand you couldn't see it. So you had no visual feedback and you had no proprioceptive feedback about what the position or\nactivity of your arm was. And now you're asked, okay,\ngiven this thing on the screen that's moving from left to\nright, match that speed. And you basically can\ntry your best to invoke whatever that imagined\naction is in your brain that's moving the cursor\nfrom left to right. But in any situation,\nyou're gonna be inaccurate and maybe inconsistent\nin how you do that task. And so that's sort of the fundamental challenge of open loop. The challenge with closed loop is that, once the user's given a model, and they're able to start\nmoving the mouse on their own, they're going to very\nnaturally adapt to that model. And that co-adaptation\nbetween the model learning, what they're doing, and the user learning how to use the model may\nnot find you the best sort of global minima. And maybe that your first\nmodel was noisy in some ways or maybe just had some like quirk, like if there's some like\npart of the data distribution that didn't cover super well,\nand the user now figures out because they're a\nbrilliant user like Noland. They figured out the right\nsequence of imagined motions or the right angle they\nhave to hold their hand at to get it to work. And they'll get it to work great, but then the next day, they\ncome back to their device and maybe they don't remember exactly all the tricks that they\nused the previous day. And so there's a complicated\nsort of feedback cycle here that can emerge and can make it a very, very difficult debugging process. - Okay, there's a lot of really\nfascinating things there. Yeah, actually, just to\nstay on the closed loop, I've seen situations,\nthis actually happened watching psychology grad students. They use piece of software\nwhen they don't know how to program themselves. They use piece of software\nthat somebody else wrote, and it has a bunch of bugs. And they figure out like, and they've been using it for years. They figured out ways to work around it. Oh, that just happens. Like nobody like considers\nmaybe we should fix this. They just adapt. And that's a really interesting notion, that we were really good at\nadapting, but you need to still, that might not be the optimal. Okay, so how do you solve that problem? Do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while kind of thing? - Yeah, it's a good question. First and foremost, I would say this is not a solved problem. And for anyone who's listening in academia who works on BCIs, I would\nalso say this is not a problem that's solved by simply\nscaling channel account. Maybe that can help and you can get sort of richer covariance structures that you can use to exploit when trying to come up with\ngood labeling strategies. But if you're interested in problems, that aren't gonna be solved inherently by scaling channel account,\nthis is one of them. Yeah, so how do you solve it? It's not a solved problem. That's the first thing I\nwanna make sure gets across. The second thing is, any solution\nthat involves closed loop is going to become a very\ndifficult debugging problem. And one of my sort of general\nheuristics for choosing what prompts to tackle is\nthat you wanna choose the one that's gonna be the easiest to debug, 'cause if you can do that, even if the ceiling is\nlower, you're gonna be able to move faster because you have a tighter iteration loop debugging the problem. And in the open loop setting, there's not a feedback cycle debug with the user in the loop. And so there's some reason to think that that should be an\neasier debugging problem. The other thing that's worth understanding is that even in a closed loop setting, there's no special software\nmagic of how to infer what the user is truly attempting to do. In the closed loop setting,\nalthough they're moving the cursor on the screen, they\nmay be attempting something different than what your\nmodel is outputting. So what the model is\noutputting is not a signal that you can use to retrain\nif you want to be able to improve the model further. You still have this very\ncomplicated guesstimation or unsupervised problem of figuring out what is the true user intention\nunderlying that signal. And so the open loop problem\nhas the nice property of being easy to debug. And the second nice property of, it has all the same\ninformation and content as the closed loop scenario. Another thing I wanna mention and call out is that this problem\ndoesn't need to be solved in order to give useful control to people. Even today with the solutions we have now and that academia has\nbuilt up over decades, the level of control that can be given to a user today is quite useful. It doesn't need to be solved to get to that level of control. But again, I wanna build\nthe world's best mouse. I wanna make it so good that it's not even a\nquestion that you want it. And to build the world's best\nmouse, the superhuman version, you really need to nail that problem. And a couple maybe details\nof previous studies that we've done internally that\nI think are very interesting to understand when thinking\nabout how to solve this problem, the first is that even when\nyou have ground truth data of what the user's trying to do, and you can get this with\nan able-bodied monkey, a monkey that has a\nNeuralink device implanted and moving a mouse to control a computer, even with that ground truth dataset, it turns out that the\noptimal thing to predict to produce high performance BCI is not just the direct\ncontrol of the mouse. You can imagine building dataset of what's going on in the brain and what is the mouse\nexactly doing on the table. And it turns out that\nif you build the mapping from neuro spikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing,\nthat model will perform worse than a model that\nis trained to predict sort of higher level assumptions about what the user might be trying to do. For example, assuming\nthat the monkey is trying to go in a straight line to the target, it turns out that making those assumptions is actually more effective in producing a model\nthan actually predicting the underlying hand movement. - So the intention, not like the physical\nmovement or whatever. - Yeah.\n- There's obviously a really strong correlation\nbetween the two, but the intention is a more\npowerful thing to be chasing. - [Bliss] Right. - Well, that's also super interesting. I mean, the intention\nitself is fascinating, because yes, with the BCI here, in this case, with a digital telepathy, you're acting on the\nintention, not the action, which is why there's an experience of like feeling like it's happening before you meant for it to happen. That is so cool. And that is why you could achieve like superhuman performance problem in terms of the control of the mouse. So for open loop, just to clarify, so whenever the person is tasked to like move the mouse to the right, you said there's not feedback so they don't get to get that satisfaction of like actually getting\nit to move, right? - You could imagine giving\nthe user feedback on a screen, but it's difficult, because at this point, you don't know what\nthey're attempting to do. So what can you show them\nthat would basically give them a signal of I'm doing this\ncorrectly or not correctly. So let's take this very specific example. Like maybe your calibration\ntask looks like you're trying to move the cursor a\ncertain position offset. So your instructions to the user are, \"Hey, the cursor's here. Now, when the cursor disappears, imagine moving it 200\npixels from where it was to the right to be over this target.\" In that kind of scenario,\nyou could imagine coming up with some sort of consistency\nmetric that you could display to the user of, \"Okay, I\nknow what the spike train looks like on average when you\ndo this action to the right. Maybe I can produce some sort\nof probabilistic estimate of how likely is that to\nbe the action you took given the latest trial or\ntrajectory that you imagined.\" And that could give the\nuser some sort of feedback of how consistent are they\nacross different trials. You could also imagine that\nif the user is prompted with that kind of consistency metric, that maybe they just become more behaviorally engaged to begin with because the task is kind of boring when you don't have any feedback at all. And so there may be benefits\nto the user experience of showing something on the screen, even if it's not accurate,\njust because it keeps the user motivated to try to increase that number or push it upwards. - So there's a psychology element here. - Yeah, absolutely. - And again, all of that is UX challenge. How much signal drift is there,\nhour to hour, day to day, week to week, month to month? How often do you have to recalibrate because of the signal drift? - Yeah, so this is a\nproblem we've worked on, both with NHP, non-human primates,\nbefore our clinical trial and then also with Noland\nduring the clinical trial. Maybe the first thing that's worth stating is what the goal is here. So the goal is really to enable the user to have a plug and play experience where I guess they don't\nhave to plug anything in, but a play experience where they can use the device whenever they want\nto, however they want to. And that's really what we're aiming for. And so there can be a set of solutions that get to that state without considering this non-stationary problem. So maybe the first solution\nhere that's important is that they can recalibrate\nwhenever they want. This is something that Noland\nhas the ability to do today. So he can recalibrate the system at 2:00 AM in the middle of the night, without his caretaker or\nparents or friends around to help push a button for him. The other important part\nof the solution is that when you have a good model calibrated, that you can continue using that without needing to recalibrate it. So how often he has to do\nthis recalibration today depends really on his\nappetite for performance. We observe sort of a\ndegradation through time of how well any individual model works, but this can be mitigated behaviorally by the user adapting\ntheir control strategy. It can also be mitigated\nthrough a combination of sort of software features\nthat we provide to the user. For example, we let\nthe user adjust exactly how fast the cursor is moving. We call that the gain, for example, the gain of how fast the cursor reacts to any given input intention. They can also adjust the smoothing, how smooth the output of that\ncursor intention actually is. They can also adjust the friction, which is how easy is it\nto stop and hold still. And all these software tools\nallow the user a great deal of flexibility and\ntroubleshooting mechanisms to be able to solve this problem for themselves.\n- By the way, all of this is done by looking to the right side of the screen, selecting the mixer,\nand the mixer you have- - It's like DJ mode. DJ mode for your VCI. - So I mean, it's a really\nwell done interface. It's really, really well done. And so yeah, there's that bias\nthat there's a cursor drift that Noland talked about in a stream, although he said that you\nguys were just playing around with it with him and then\nconstantly improving. So that could have been just a snapshot of that particular\nmoment, a particular day. But he said that there\nwas this cursor drift and this bias that\ncould be removed by him, I guess looking to the\nright side of the screen, the left side of the screen\nto kind of adjust the bias. - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's one interface action I guess to adjust the bias. - Yeah, so this is actually an idea that comes out of academia. There are some prior work\nwith sort of BrainGate clinical trial participants\nwhere they pioneered this idea of bias correction. The way we've done it I think is, yeah, it's very prototized, very beautiful user experience where the user can essentially flash the cursor over to\nthe side of the screen and it opens up a window\nwhere they can actually sort of adjust or tune exactly\nthe bias of the cursor. So bias maybe, for people\nwho aren't familiar, is just sort of what is the default motion of the cursor if you're imagining nothing. And it turns out that\nthat's one of the first sort of qualia of the\ncursor control experience that's impacted by neuro non-stationarity. - Quality off the cursor experience. - I don't know how else to describe it. I'm not the guy moving- - It's very poetic, I love it. The quality of the cursor experience. Yeah, I mean, it sounds poetic but it is deeply true. There is an experience,\nwhen it works well, it is a joyful, a really\npleasant experience. And when it doesn't work well, it's a very frustrating experience. That's actually the art of UX. It's like you have the\npossibility to frustrate people or the possibility to give them joy, - And at the end of the day,\nit really is truly the case that UX is how the thing works. And so it's not just like\nwhat's showing on the screen, it's also what control surfaces does a decode provide the user? Like we want them to feel\nlike they're in the F1 card, not like some like minivan, right? And that really truly is\nhow we think about it. Noland himself is an F1 fan, so we refer to ourself as a pit crew. He really is truly the F1 driver, and there's different control surfaces that different kinds of cars\nand airplanes provide the user. And we take a lot of inspiration\nfrom that when designing how the cursor should behave.. And what maybe one nuance of this is, even details like when you move a mouse on a MacBook track pad,\nthe sort of response curve of how that input that\nyou give the track pad translates to cursor movement is different than how it works with a mouse. When you move on the track pad, there's a different response function, a different curve to how much\na movement translates to input to the computer than when you\ndo it physically with a mouse. And that's because somebody\nsat down a long time ago when they're designed\nthe initial input systems to any computer and they\nthought through exactly how it feels to use\nthese different systems. And now we're designing\nsort of the next generation of this input system to a\ncomputer, which is entirely done via the brain, and there's\nno proprioceptive feedback. Again, you don't feel\nthe mouse in your hand, you don't feel the keys\nunder your fingertips, and you want a control surface\nthat still makes it easy and intuitive for the user to understand the state of the system and how to achieve what\nthey wanna achieve. And ultimately, the end goal\nis that that UX is completely, it fades into the background. It becomes something that's\nso natural and intuitive that it's subconscious to the user, and they just should feel\nlike they have basically direct control over the cursor. It just does what they want it to do. They're not thinking\nabout the implementation of how to make it do\nwhat they want it to do. It's just doing what they want it to do. - Is there some kind of things along the lines of like Fitts' law where you should move the\nmouse in a certain kind of way that maximizes your\nchance to hit the target? I don't even know what I'm asking, but I'm hoping the\nintention of my question will land on a profound answer. No, is there some kind of understanding of the laws of UX when\nit comes to the context of somebody using their\nbrain to control it? Like that's different\nthan actual with a mouse? - I think we're in the early stages of discovering those\nlaws, so I wouldn't claim to have solved that problem yet. But there's definitely\nsome things we've learned that make it easier for\nthe user to get stuff done. And it's pretty straightforward\nwhen you verbalize it, but it takes a while to\nactually get to that point when you're in the process of debugging the stuff in the trenches. One of those things is that\nany machine learning system you build has some number of errors, and it matters how those errors translate to the downstream user experience. For example, if you're\ndeveloping a search algorithm in your photos, if you\nsearch for your friend Joe and it pulls up a photo\nof your friend Josephine, maybe that's not a big deal\nbecause the cost of an error is not that high. In a different scenario where you're trying to\ndetect insurance fraud or something like this and\nyou're directly sending someone to court because of some\nmachine learning model output, then the errors make a lot\nmore sense to be careful about. You wanna be very thoughtful about how those errors translate\nto downstream effects. The same is true in BCI. So for example, if you're building a model that's decoding a velocity\noutput from the brain versus an output where\nyou're trying to modulate the left click, for example. These have sort of different trade-offs of how precise you need to be before it becomes useful to the end user. For velocity, it's okay\nto be on average correct, because the output of the model\nis integrated through time. So if the user's trying\nto click at position A, and they're currently in position B, they're trying to navigate over time to get between those two points. And as long as the output of the model is on average correct,\nthey can sort of steer it through time with the user\ncontrol loop in the mix. They can get to the\npoint they wanna get to. The same is not true of a click. For a click, you're\nperforming it almost instantly at the scale of neurons firing. And so you want to be very\nsure that that click is correct because a false click can be\nvery destructive to the user. They might accidentally close\nthe tab that they're trying to do something and\nlose all their progress. They might accidentally like hit some Send button on some text that it's only like half-composed\nand reads funny after. So there's different\nsort of cost functions associated with errors in this space. And part of the UX design is understanding how to build a solution\nthat is when it's wrong, still useful to the end user. - It's so fascinating that assigning cost to every action when an error occurs. So every action, if an error\noccurs, has a certain cost, and incorporating that into how\nyou interpret the intention, mapping it to the action\nis really important. I didn't quite until you said it realize there's a cost to like\nsending the text early. It's like very expensive cost.\n- Yeah. It's super annoying if you accidentally, like if you're a cursor,\nimagine if your cursor misclick every once in a while,\nthat's like super obnoxious. And the worst part of it is, usually, when the user's trying to click,\nthey're also holding still because they're over the\ntarget they wanna hit and they're getting ready to click, which means that in the data\nsets that we build, on average, it's the case that sort of low speeds or desire to hold still. It's correlated with when the\nuser's attempting to click. - Wow, that is really fascinating. - It's also not the case. People think that, \"Oh, a\nclick is a binary signal. This must be super easy to decode.\" Well, yes it is, but the bar is so much higher for it to become a useful thing for the user, and there's ways to solve this. I mean, you can sort of take\nthe compound approach of, well, let's just give the like, let's take five seconds to click. Let's take a huge window of time so it can be very\nconfident about the answer. But again, world's best mouse. The world's best mouse\ndoesn't take a second to click or 500 milliseconds to click. It takes five milliseconds\nto click or less. And so if you're aiming\nfor that kind of high bar, then you really wanna solve\nthe underlying problem. - So maybe this is a\ngood place to ask about how to measure performance,\nthis whole bits per second. Can you like explain\nwhat you mean by that? Maybe a good place to start is to talk about Webgrid as a game, as a good illustration of the\nmeasurement of performance. - Yeah, maybe I'll take\none zoom out step there, which is just explaining why\nwe care to measure this at all. So again, our goal is to\nprovide the user the ability to control the computer as well as I can and hopefully better. And that means that they can do it at the same speed as what I can do. It means that they have access to all the same functionality that I have, including all those little\ndetails like command tab, command space, all this stuff. They need to be able to\ndo it with their brain and with the same level of reliability as what I can do with my muscles. And that's a high bar. And so we intend to measure and quantify every aspect of that to understand how we're progressing towards that goal. There's many ways to\nmeasure BPS, by the way. This isn't the only way,\nbut we present the user a creative targets, and basically, we compute a score which\nis dependent on how fast and accurate they can select, and then how small are the targets. And the more targets\nthat are on the screen, the smaller they are, the more information\nyou present per click. And so if you think about\nit from information theory point of view, you can communicate across different information\ntheoretic channels. And one such channel is a typing interface you could imagine that's\nbuilt out of a grid, just like a software\nkeyboard on the screen. And bits per second is a\nmeasure that's computed by taking the log of the number\nof targets on the screen. You can subtract one if you\ncare to model a keyboard because you have to subtract one for the Delete key on the keyboard, but log of the number\nof targets on the screen times the number of correct\nselections minus incorrect, divided by some time window. For example, 60 seconds. And that's sort of the standard way to measure a cursor\ncontrol task in academia. And all credit in the world\ngoes to this great professor, Dr. Shenoy of Stanford who\ncame up with that task. And he's also one of my\ninspirations for being in the field. So all the credit in the world to him for coming up with a standardized metric to facilitate this kind of\nbragging rights that we have now, to say that Noland is\nthe best in the world at this task with his BCI. It's very important for progress that you have standardized\nmetrics that people can compare across different\ntechniques and approaches. How well does this do? So yeah, big kudos to him and\nto all the team at Stanford. Yeah, so for Noland, and\nfor me playing this task, there's also different modes that you can configure this task. So the Webgrid task can be presented as just sort of a left\nclick on the screen, or you could have targets\nthat you just dwell over, or you could have targets\nthat you left, right click on. You could have targets\nthat are left, right click, middle click, scrolling,\nclicking, and dragging. You could do all sorts of things within this general framework. But the simplest, purest\nform is just blue targets show up on the screen. Blue means left click. That's the simplest form of the game. And the sort of prior\nrecords here in academic work and at Neuralink internally with sort of NPS have all been matched or beaten by Noland with\nhis Neuralink device. So sort of prior to Neuralink,\nthe sort of world record for a human using device\nis somewhere between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS, depending on exactly what paper you read and\nhow you interpret it. Noland's current record is 8.5 BPS. And again, this sort of median Neuralink performance is 10 BPS. So you can think of it roughly as he's 85% the level of control\nof a median Neuralinker using their cursor to select\nblue targets on the screen. And yeah, I think there's a\nvery interesting journey ahead to get us to that same\nlevel of 10 BPS performance. It's not the case that sort\nof the tricks that got us from four to six BPS,\nand then six to eight BPS are gonna be the ones that\nget us from eight to 10. And in my view, the core challenge here is really the labeling problem. It's how do you understand at\na very, very fine resolution what the user's attempting to do. And yeah, I highly encourage folks in academia to work on this problem. - What's the journey\nwith Noland on that quest of increasing the BPS on Webgrid? In March, you said that he selected 89,285 targets in Webgrid. - Yep.\n- So he loves this game. He's really serious about improving his performance in this game. So what is that journey\nof trying to figure out how to improve that performance? How much can that be done\non the decoding side? How much can that be done\non the calibration side? How much can that be\ndone on the Noland side of like figuring out how to convey his intention more cleanly? - Yeah, no, this is a great question. So in my view, one of\nthe primary reasons why Noland's performance is so\ngood is because of Noland. Noland is extremely\nfocused and very energetic. He'll play Webgrid sometimes\nfor like four hours in the middle of the night. Like from 2:00 AM to 6:00\nAM, he'll be playing Webgrid, just because he wants to push it to the limits of what he can do. And this is not us like\nasking him to do that. I wanna be clear. Like we're not saying, \"Hey, you should play Webgrid tonight.\" We just gave him the game\nas part of our research, and he is able to play it independently and practice whenever he wants, and he really pushes hard to push it, the technology's the absolute limit. And he views that as like his job really to make us be the bottleneck. And boy, has he done that well. And so the first thing\nto acknowledge is that he's extremely motivated\nto make this work. I've also had the privilege to meet other clinical trial participants\nfrom BrainGate and other trials, and they very much\nshared the same attitude of like they view this\nas their life's work to advance the technology\nas much as they can. And if that means selecting\ntargets on the screen for four hours from 2:00 AM\nto 6:00 AM, then so be it. And there's something\nextremely admirable about that that's worth calling out. Okay, so then how do you sort of get from where he started, which is\nno cursor control to a BPS? So I mean, when he started, there's a huge amount of learning to do on his side and our side to figure out what's the most intuitive control for him. And the most intuitive\ncontrol for him is sort of, you have to find the set intersection of what do we have this signal to decode. So we don't pick up every single\nneuron in the motor cortex, which means we don't have representation for every part of the body. So there may be some\nsignals that we have better sort of decode performance on than others. For example, on his left hand,\nwe have a lot of difficulty distinguishing his left ring finger from his left middle finger. But on his right hand,\nwe have a good control and good modulation\ndetected from the neurons that we're able to record for his pinky, his thumb, and his index finger. So you can imagine how these different sub spaces of modulated activity intersect with what's the\nmost intuitive for him. And this has evolved over time. So once we gave him the ability to calibrate models on his own, he was able to go and explore\nvarious different ways to imagine controlling the cursor. For example, he could imagine\ncontrolling the cursor by wiggling his wrist side to side, or by moving his entire arm. I think at one point, he did his feet. He tried like a whole bunch\nof stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor. That at the same time, it's\neasy for us to decode rules. - Just to clarify, it's through\nthe body mapping procedure that you're able to figure\nout which finger he can move? - Yes, yeah, that's one way to do it. Maybe one nuance of when he's doing it, he can imagine many more things than we represent in that\nvisual on the screen. So we show him sort of\nabstractly, \"Here's a cursor. You figure out what\nworks the best for you.\" And we obviously have hints\nabout what will work best from that body mapping procedure of we know that this particular action, we can represent well. But it's really up to\nhim to go and explore and figure out what works the best. - But at which point does\nhe no longer visualize the movement of his body\nand is just visualizing the movement of the cursor? - Yeah.\n- How quickly does he go from, how quickly does he get there? - So this happened on a Tuesday. I remember this day very clearly, because at some point during the day, it looked like he wasn't doing super well. It looked like the model\nwasn't performing super well and he was like getting distracted. But he actually, it wasn't the case. Like what actually happened\nwas he was trying something new where he was just controlling the cursor. So he wasn't imagining\nmoving his hand anymore. He was just imagining,\nI don't know what it is, some like abstract intention to move the cursor on the screen. And I cannot tell you what the difference between those two things are. I really truly cannot. He's tried to explain it to me before. I cannot give a first person\naccount of what that's like. But the expletives that\nhe uttered in that moment were enough to suggest that it was a very qualitatively\ndifferent experience for him to just have direct\nneural control over a cursor. - I wonder if there's a way through UX to encourage a human\nbeing to discover that, because he discovered\nit, like you said to me, that he's a pioneer. So he discovered that on\nhis own through all of this, the process of trying to move the cursor with different kinds of intentions. But that is clearly a really\npowerful thing to arrive at, which is to let go of trying\nto control the fingers and the hand and control the actual digital device with your mind. - That's right, UX is how it works. And the ideal UX is one\nthat the user doesn't have to think about what they need to do in order to get it done. It just does it. - That is so fascinating. But I wonder on the biological side how long it takes for the brain to adapt. - Yeah.\n- So is it just simply learning like high level software, or is there like a\nneuroplasticity component where like the brain is adjusting slowly? - Yeah, the truth is, I don't know. I'm very excited to see with\nsort of the second participant that we implant what the\njourney is like for them, because we'll have learned a lot more. Potentially, we can help them understand and explore that direction more quickly. This is something I didn't know. This wasn't me prompting\nNoland to go try this. He was just exploring\nhow to use his device and figure it out himself. But now that we know that\nthat's a possibility, that maybe there's a way to, for example, hint the user, \"Don't try\nsuper hard during calibration. Just do something that feels natural, or just directly control the cursor. Don't imagine explicit action.\" And from there, we should be\nable to hopefully understand how this is for somebody who has not experienced that before. Maybe that's the default\nmode of operation for them. You don't have to go through this intermediate phase of explicit motions. - Or maybe if that naturally\nhappens for people, you can just occasionally encourage them to allow themselves to move the cursor. Actually sometimes, just\nlike with a four minute mile, just the knowledge that that's possible. - Pushes you to do it. - Yeah, enables you to do it, and then it becomes trivial. And then it also makes you wonder, it's the cool thing about humans. Once there's a lot more\nhuman participants, they will discover\nthings that are possible. - Yes, and share their experiences. - Yeah, and share.\n- With each other. - And that because of them sharing it, they'll be able to do it. All of a sudden, that's\nunlocked for everybody, because just the knowledge sometimes is the thing that enables it to do it. - Yeah, I mean, and just\nto comment on that too, we've probably tried like\na thousand different ways to do various aspects of decoding, and now we know like what\nthe right subspace is to continue exploring further. Again, thanks to Noland and the many hours he's put into this. And so even just that help, like help constraints\nsort of the beam search of different approaches\nthat we could explore really helps accelerate\nfor the next person the set of things that\nwe'll get to try on day one, how fast we hope to get\nthem to useful control, how fast we can enable 'em\nto use it independently, and to get value out of the system. So yeah, massive hats off to Noland and all the participants\nthat came before him to make this technology a reality. - So how often are the\nupdates to the decoder? 'Cause Noland mentioned like, okay, there's a new update\nthat we're working on, and that in the stream, he said he plays the snake game\nbecause it's like super hard. It's a good way for him to test\nlike how good the update is. And he says like sometimes the\nupdate is a step backwards. It's a constant like iteration. Like what does the update entail? Is it mostly on the decoder side? - Yeah, a couple comments. So one is it's probably\nworth drawing distinction between sort of research sessions where we're actively\ntrying different things to understand like what\nthe best approach is versus sort of independent\nuse where we wanted to have an ability to just go use the device, how anybody would wanna use their MacBook. And so what he's referring to is, I think usually in the\ncontext of a research session, where we're trying many,\nmany different approaches to even unsupervised approaches like we talked about earlier to try to come up with better ways to estimate his true intention and more accurately decode it. And in those scenarios, I mean we try, in any given session, he'll sometimes work for like eight hours a day. And so that can be hundreds\nof different models that we would try in that day. Like a lot of different things. Now, it's also worth noting that we update the application he uses quite frequently. I think sometimes, up to like\nfour or five times a day. We'll update his application\nwith different features or bug fixes or feedback\nthat he's given us. He's a very articulate person\nwho is part of the solution. He's not a complaining person. He says, \"Hey, here's this\nthing that I've discovered is not optimal in my flow. Here's some ideas how to fix it. Let me know what your thoughts are. Let's figure out how to solve it.\" And it often happens that\nthose things are addressed within a couple hours of\nhim giving us his feedback. That's the kind of\niteration cycle we'll have. And so sometimes, at the\nbeginning of the session, he'll give us feedback, and\nat the end of the session, he's giving us feedback\non the next iteration of that process or that set up. - That's fascinating,\nbecause one of the things you mentioned, that there\nwas 271 pages of notes taken from the BCI sessions,\nand this was just in March. So one of the amazing\nthings about human beings that they can provide,\nespecially ones who are smart and excited and all like positive\nand good vibes like Nolan, that they can provide\nfeedback, continuous feedback. - Yeah, it also requires, just to brag on the team a little bit, I work with a lot of exceptional people, and it requires the team\nbeing absolutely laser focused on the user and what will\nbe the best for them. And it requires like a\nlevel of commitment of, \"Okay, this is what the user feedback was. I have all these meetings. We're gonna skip that today\nand we're gonna do this.\" That level of focus\ncommitment is, I would say, underappreciated in the world. And also, you obviously\nhave to have the talent to be able to execute on\nthese things effectively. And yeah, we have that in loads. - Yeah, and this is such a\ninteresting space of UX design because there's so many unknowns here. And I can tell UX is difficult because of how many people do it poorly. It's just not a trivial thing. - Yeah, it's also, you know, UX is not something that\nyou can always solve by just constant iterating\non different things. Like sometimes, you\nreally need to step back and think globally, am\nI even in like the right sort of minima to be\nchasing down for a solution? Like there's a lot of problems in which sort of fast iteration\ncycle is the predictor of how successful you will be. As a good example, like in\nRL simulation, for example, the more frequently you get reward, the faster you can progress. It's just an easier learning prompt, the more frequently you get feedback. But UX is not that way. I mean, users are\nactually quite often wrong about what the right solution is, and it requires a deep understanding\nof the technical system and what's possible, combined with what the problem\nis you're trying to solve. Not just how the user expressed it, but what the true underlying problem is to actually get to the right place. - Yeah, that's the old like stories of Steve Jobs like rolling in there, like, yeah, the user is a useful signal, but it's not a perfect signal. And sometimes, you have to\nremove the floppy disk drive or whatever the, I forgot\nall the crazy stories of Steve Jobs like making\nwild design decisions. But there, some of it is aesthetic, that some of it is about the\nlove you put into the design, which is very much a Steve\nJobs-Jony Ive type of thing. But when you have a human\nbeing using their brain to interact with it, it also\nis deeply about function. It's not just aesthetic. And that you have to empathize with a human being before you, while not always listening\nto them directly. Like you have to deeply empathize. It's fascinating. It's really, really fascinating. And at the same time, iterate. But not iterate in small ways. Sometimes, a complete like\nrebuilding the design. He said that, Noland said in the early\ndays, the UX sucked. But you improved quickly. What was that journey like? - Yeah, I mean, I'll give\none concrete example. So he really wanted to\nbe able to read manga. This is something that he, I mean, it sounds like a simple thing, but it's actually a\nreally big deal for him. And he couldn't do it\nwith his mouth stick. It wasn't accessible. You can't scroll with a\nmouse stick on his iPad on the website that he\nwanted to be able to use to read the newest manga. - Might be a good quick pause to say the mouth stick\nis the thing he's using, holding a stick in his\nmouth to scroll on a tablet. - Right, yeah, it's basically, you can imagine it's a stylus that you hold between your teeth. Yeah, it's basically a very long stylus. - And it's exhausting, it hurts, and it's inefficient. - Yeah, and maybe it's\nalso worth calling out, there are other alternative\nassisted technologies, but the particular situation Noland's in, and this is not uncommon, and I think it's also not\nwell understood by folks, is that he's relatively spastic so he'll have muscle\nspasms from time to time. And so any assistive\ntechnology that requires him to be positioned directly\nin front of a camera, for example, an eye tracker, or anything that requires him\nto put something in his mouth just is a no go, 'cause he'll either be shifted out of frame\nwhen he has a spasm, or if he has something in his mouth, it'll stab him in the face\nif he spasms too hard. So these kind of\nconsiderations are important when thinking about what advantages a BCI has in someone's life. If it fits ergonomically into your life in a way that you can use it independently when your caretaker's not\nthere, wherever you want to, either in the bed or in the chair, depending on your comfort level and your desire to have pressure sores, all these factors matter a lot in how good the solution\nis in that user's life. So one of these very\nfun examples is scroll. So again, manga is something\nhe wanted to be able to read, and there's many ways\nto do scroll with a BCI. You can imagine like different\ngestures, for example. The user could do that,\nwould move the page. But scroll is a very\nfascinating control surface, because it's a huge thing on\nthe screen in front of you. So any sort of jitter in the model output, any sort of error in the model output causes like an earthquake on the screen. Like you really don't\nwanna have your manga page you're trying to read be\nshifted up and down a few pixels just because your scroll decoder\nis not completely accurate. And so this was an example\nwhere we had to figure out how to formulate the problem in a way that the errors of the system,\nwhenever they do occur, and we'll do our best to minimize them, whenever those errors do occur, that it doesn't interrupt the qualia again of the experience that the user is having. It doesn't interrupt their\nflow of reading their book. And so what we ended up building is this really brilliant feature. This is teammate named Ruse, who worked on this really brilliant work called quick scroll. And quick scroll basically\nlooks at the screen, and it identifies where on\nthe screen are scroll bars. And it does this by deeply\nintegrated with MacOs to understand where are the\nscroll bars actively present on the screen using the\nsort of accessibility tool that's available to MacOs apps. And we identified where\nthose scroll bars are and we provided a BCI scroll bar. And the BCI scroll bar looks\nsimilar to a normal scroll bar but it behaves very differently in that once you sort of move over to it, your cursor sort of morphs onto it. It sort of attaches or latches onto it. And then once you push up or down in the same way that you'd\nuse a push to control the normal cursor, it actually\nmoves the screen for you. So it's basically like\nremapping the velocity to a scroll action. And the reason that feels so\nnatural and intuitive is that, when you move over to attach\nto it, it feels like magnetic. So you're like sort of stuck onto it. And then it's one continuous action. You don't have to like switch\nyour imagined movement. You sort of snap onto it\nand then you're good to go. You just immediately can start pulling the page down or pushing it up. And even once you get that right, there's so many little nuances of how the scroll behavior works to make it natural and intuitive. So one example is momentum. Like when you scroll a page\nwith your fingers on the screen, you actually have some like flow. Like it doesn't just stop right when you lift your finger up. The same is true with BCI scroll. So we had to spend some time to figure out what are the right nuances. When you don't feel the screen\nunder your fingertip anymore, what is the right sort of dynamic or what's the right amount\nof page give, if you will, when you push it to make\nit flow the right amount for the user to have a natural experience reading their book. And there's a million, I mean, I could tell you like there's\nso many little minutia of how exactly that scroll works\nthat we spent probably like a month getting right to make\nthat feel extremely natural and easy for the user to navigate. - I mean, even to scroll on\na smartphone with your finger feels extremely natural and pleasant. And it probably takes\na extremely long time to get that right. And actually, the same\nkind of visionary UX design that we're talking about, don't\nalways listen to the users but also listen to them, and\nalso have like visionary big, like throw everything out, think from first principles but also not. Yeah, yeah, by the way,\nit just makes me think that scroll bars on the desktop probably have stagnated\nand never taken that like, 'cause the snap, same\nas like snap the grid, snap the scroll bar action\nyou're talking about is something that could\npotentially be extremely useful in the desktop setting, even just for users to just\nimprove the experience, 'cause the current scroll bar experience in the desktop is horrible.\n- Yeah, agreed. - It's hard to find, hard to control. There's not a momentum. And the intention should be clear. When I start moving towards a scroll bar, there should be a snapping\nto the scroll bar action. But of course, maybe I'm\nokay paying that cost, but there's hundreds of millions of people paying that cost nonstop. But anyway, but in this case, this is necessary because\nthere's an extra cost paid by Noland for the jitteriness. So you have to switch between\nthe scrolling and the reading. There has to be a phase\nshift between the two. Like when you're scrolling,\nyou're scrolling. - Right, right, so that is one drawback of the current approach. Maybe one other just\nsort of case study here, so again, UX is how it works, and we think about that\nholistically from like the, even the feature detection level of what we detect in the brain\nto how we design the decoder, what we choose to decode,\nto then how it works once it's being used by the user. So another good example in\nthe sort of how it works once they're actually using the decoder, the output that's displayed on the screen is not just what the decoder says. It's also a function of\nwhat's going on on the screen. So we can understand, for example, that when you're trying to close a tab, that very small, stupid little\nX that's extremely tiny, which is hard to get precisely hit if you're dealing with sort of a noisy output of the decoder, we can understand that that is a small little\nX you might be trying to hit and actually make it a\nbigger target for you. Similar to how when you're\ntyping on your phone, if you are used to like the\niOS keyboard, for example, it actually adapts the target size of individual keys based on\nan underlying language model. So it'll actually\nunderstand if I'm typing, \"Hey, I'm going to see L.\" It'll make the E key bigger, because in those Lex is the\nperson I'm gonna go see. And so that kind of predictiveness\ncan make the experience much more smooth even without improvements to the underlying decoder or feature detection part of the stack. So we do that with a feature\ncalled magnetic targets. We actually indexed the\nscreen and we understand, okay, these are the places\nthat are very small targets that might be difficult to hit. Here's the kind of cursor\ndynamics around that location that might be indicative of\nthe user trying to select it. Let's make it easier. Let's blow up the size of it in a way that makes it easier for the user to sort of snap onto that target. So all these little\ndetails, they matter a lot in helping the user be independent in their day-to-day living. - So how much of the work on the decoder is generalizable to P2, P3, P4, P5, PM? How do you improve the decoder in a way that's generalizable? - Yeah, great question. So the underlying signal\nwe're trying to decode is gonna look very\ndifferent in P2 than in P1. For example, channel\nnumber 345 is gonna mean something different in user\none than it will in user two, just because that\nelectrode that corresponds with channel 345 is gonna be\nnext to a different neuron in user one versus user two. But the approach is the methods, the user experience of\nhow do you get the right sort of behavioral pattern from the user to associate with that neural signal, we hope that will translate over multiple generations of users. And beyond that, it's very, very possible. In fact, quite likely that we've overfit to sort of Noland's user\nexperience desires and preferences. And so what I hope to see is that when we get second,\nthird, fourth participant, that we find sort of what\nthe right wide minimums are that cover all the cases, that make it more intuitive for everyone. And hopefully, there's a\ncrosspollination of things where, \"Oh, we didn't think\nabout that with this user, because they can speak. But with this user who\njust can fundamentally not speak at all, this user\nexperience is not optimal.\" And that will actually, those improvements that we make there should hopefully translate then to even people who can't speak but don't feel comfortable doing so because we're in a public setting, like their doctor's office. - So the actual mechanism\nof open loop labeling and then closed loop\nlabeling will be the same, and hopefully, can generalize\nacross the different users as they're doing the calibration step. And the calibration step is pretty cool. I mean, that in itself, the interesting thing about Webgrid, which is like closed loop, it's like fun. I love it when there's like, they used to be kind of\nidea of human computation, which is using actions a\nhuman would want to do anyway to get a lot of signal from. - Yeah.\n- And like Webgrid is that, like a nice video game that also serves as great calibration. - It's so funny. I've heard this reaction so many times. Before sort of the first\nuser was implanted, we had an internal perception that the first user\nwould not find this fun. And so we thought really quite\na bit actually about like, should we build other games that like are more\ninteresting for the user so we can get this kind of data and help facilitate research for long duration and stuff like this? Turns out that like people love this game. - Yeah.\n- I always loved it, but I didn't know that that\nwas a shared perception. - Yeah, and just in case\nit's not clear, Webgrid is, there's a grid of, let's\nsay 35 by 35 cells, and one of them lights up blue and you have to move your mouse\nover that and click on it. And if you miss it and it's red- - [Bliss] I played this\ngame for so many hours. So many hours. - And what's your record, you said? - I think I have the highest at Neuralink. Right now, my record's 17 BPS. - 17 BPS.\n- Which is about, if you imagine that 35 by 35 grid, you're hitting about 100\ntrials per minute in. So 100 correct selections\nin that one minute window. So you're averaging about, between 500, 600\nmilliseconds per selection. - So one of the reasons\nthat I think I struggle with that game is I'm\nsuch a keyboard person, so everything is done with via keyboard. If I can avoid touching\nthe mouse, it's great. So how can you explain\nyour high performance? - I have like a whole ritual I go through when I play Webgrid. So it's actually like a diet\nplan associated with this. Like it's a whole thing, so great. - The first thing-\n- You have to fast for five days, have to\ngo up to the mountains. - Actually, it kind of, I mean, the fasting thing is important. So this is like, you know- - Focuses the mind, yeah?\n- Yeah, it's true. So what I do is actually, I don't eat for a little bit beforehand. And then I'll actually eat\nlike a ton of peanut butter right before, and I get like- - This is a real thing?\n- This is a real thing, yeah. And then it has to be\nreally late at night. This is again a night owl\nthing I think we share, but it has to be like midnight,\n2:00 AM kind of time window. And I have a very specific like physical position I'll sit in, which is, I used to be, I\nwas homeschooled growing up and so I did most of my\nwork like on the floor, just like in my bedroom or whatever. And so I have a very specific\nsituation on the floor. On the floor, I sit and play, and then you have to make sure like there's not a lot\nof weight on your elbow when you're playing so\nthat you can move quickly. And then I turn the gain of the cursor, so the speed of the cursor way, way up. So it's like small motions\nthat actually move the cursor. - Are you moving with your wrist or you're never moving on- - I move my fingers. So my wrist is almost completely still. I'm just moving my fingers. - Yeah. You know those, just on a small tangent, which I've been meaning to\ngo down this rabbit hole of people that set the\nworld record in Tetris. Those folks, they're playing, there's a way to, did you see this? - I see like the three, like\nall the fingers are moving. - Yeah, you could find a way to do it where like it's using a loophole, like a bug that you can do\nsome incredibly fast stuff. So it's along that line but not quite. But you do realize there'll\nbe like a few programmers right now listening to this\ncool fast and eat peanut butter and be like-\n- Yeah, please, please trade my record. I mean, the reason I did this, literally, was just because I wanted\nthe bar to be high. The team, like I wanted\nthe number that we aim for should not be like the median performance. It should be able to\nbeat all of us at least. Like that should be the minimum bar. - What do you think is possible, like 20 scrapes?\n- Yeah, I don't know what the limits. I mean, the limits you can calculate just in terms of like screen refresh rate and like cursor immediately\njumping to the next target. But I mean, I'm sure\nthere's limits before that with just sort of reaction time and visual perception\nand things like this. I would guess it's in the\nbelow 40 but above 20, somewhere in there is probably the right that I'd never be thinking about. It also matters like how\ndifficult the task is. You could imagine like\nsome people might be able to do like 10,000 targets on the screen and maybe they can do better that way. There's some like task optimizations you could do to try to boost\nyour performance as well. - What do you think it takes for Noland to be able to do above 8.5? To keep increasing that number? You said like every increase in the number might require different- - [Bliss] Yeah. - Different improvements in the system. - Yeah, I think the\nnature of this work is, I mean, the first answer\nthat's important to say is, I don't know. This is edge of the research. So again, nobody's gotten\nto that number before. So what's next is gonna be a\nheuristic guess from my part. What we've seen historically\nis that different parts of the stack follow\nnext to different time points. So when I first joined Neuralink, like three years ago or so, one of the major problems\nwas just the latency of the Bluetooth connection. It was just like the radial\ndevice wasn't super good. It was an early revision of the implant, and it just like, no matter\nhow good your decoder was, if your thing is updating\nevery 30 milliseconds or 50 milliseconds, it's\njust gonna be choppy. And no matter how good you are, that's gonna be frustrating\nand lead to challenges. So at that point, it was very\nclear that the main challenge is just get the data off the\ndevice in a very reliable way, such that you can enable the\nnext challenge to be tackled. And then at some point, it was, actually, the modeling challenge of how do you just build a good mapping, like the supervised learning problem of you have a bunch of data and you have a label\nyou're trying to predict, just what is the right like\nneuro decoder architecture and hyper parameters to optimize that? And that was a problem for a bit. And once you solve that, it\nbecame a different bottleneck. I think the next bottleneck\nafter that was actually just sort of software\nstability and reliability. If you have widely varying\nsort of inference latency in your system, or your app just lags out every once in a while, it\ndecreases your ability to maintain and get in a state of flow, and it basically just disrupts\nyour control experience. And so there's a variety\nof different software bugs and improvements we made\nthat basically increased the performance of the system, made it much more\nreliable, much more stable, and led to a state where we\ncould reliably collect data to build better models with. So that was a bottleneck for a while. It's just sort of like\nthe software stack itself. If I were to guess right now, there's sort of two major directions you could think about for\nimproving BPS further. The first major direction is labeling. So labeling is again this\nfundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent. What are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond? And that, again, is a task design problem. It's a UX problem. It's a machine learning problem. It's a software problem. Sort of touches all\nthose different domains. The second thing you can think about to improve BPS further is\neither completely changing the thing you're decoding\nor just extending the number of things that you're decoding. So this is serving the direction\nof functionality, okay? So you can imagine giving more clicks. For example, a left click, a\nright click, a middle click. Different actions like\nclick and drag, for example. And that can improve the effective bit rate of your communication prosthesis. If you're trying to allow the\nuser to express themselves through any given communication channel, you can measure that with bits per second. But what action measures\nat the end of the day is how effective are they at\nnavigating their computer. And so from the perspective\nof the downstream tasks that you care about, functionality and extending functionality is something we're very interested in,\nbecause not only can it improve the sort of number of BPS, but it can also improve the downstream sort of independence that the user has and the skill and efficiency with which they can\noperate their computer. - Would the number of threads increasing also potentially help? - Yes, short answer is yes. It's a bit nuanced how that curve or how that manifests in the numbers. So what you'll see is\nthat if you sort of plot a curve of number of channels that you're using for decode versus either the offline metric of how good you are at decoding, or the online metric of\nsort of, in practice, how good is the user using this device, you see roughly a log curve. So as you move further\nout in number of channels, you get a corresponding sort\nof logarithmic improvement in control quality and\noffline validation metrics. The important nuance\nhere is that each channel corresponds with a specific represented intention in the brain. So for example, if you have a channel 254, it might correspond with\nmoving to the right. Channel 256 might mean move to the left. If you want to expand\nthe number of functions you want to control,\nyou really want to have a broader set of channels that covers a broader set\nof imagined movements. You can think of it kinda\nlike Mr. Potato man actually. Like if you had a bunch of different imagined movements you could do, how would you map those imagined movements to input to a computer? You can imagine handwriting to output characters on the screen. You can imagine just\ntyping with your fingers and have that output text on the screen. You can imagine different finger modulations for different clicks. You can imagine wiggling your big nose or opening some menu or\nwiggling your big toe to have like command tab\noccur or something like this. So it's really, the amount of different actions\nyou can take in the world depends on how many channels you have on the information\ncontent that they carry. - Right, so that's more\nabout the number of actions. So actually, as you increase\nthe number of threads, that's more about increasing the number of actions\nyou're able to perform. - One other nuance there\nthat is worth mentioning, so again, our goal is really\nto enable a user with process to control their computer\nas fast as I can. So that's BPS. With all the same functionality I have, which is what we just talked about, but then also as reliably as I can. And that last point is very related to channel account discussion. So as you scale out number of channels, the relative importance\nof any particular feature of your model input to the output control of the user diminishes, which means that if the sort\nof neural non-stationary effect is per channel, or if\nthe noise is independent, such that more channels means, on average, less output effect, then your reliability of\nyour system will improve. So one sort of core thesis\nthat at least I have is that scaling channel\naccount should improve the reliability system without any work on the decoder itself. - Can you linger on the reliability here? So first of all, when you see non-stationarity of the signal, which aspect are you referring to? - Yeah, so maybe let's talk briefly what the actual underlying\nsignal looks like. So again, I spoke very\nbriefly at the beginning about how when you imagine\nmoving to the right or imagine moving to the left, neurons might fire more or less. And their frequency\ncontent of that signal, at least in the motor cortex, it's very correlated with\nthe output intention, the behavioral task\nthat the user is doing. You can imagine actually,\nthis is not obvious, that rate coding, which is\nthe name of that phenomenon is like the only way the brain\ncould represent information. You can imagine many different ways in which the brain could encode intention. And there's actually evidence\nlike in bats, for example, that there's temporal codes. So timing codes of like exactly\nwhen particular neurons fire is the mechanism of\ninformation representation. But at least in the motor cortex, there's a substantial evidence\nthat it's rate coding, or at least one, like first order of fact is that it's rate coding. So then if the brain is\nrepresenting information by changing the sort of\nfrequency of a neuron firing, what really matters is sort of the delta between sort of the\nbaseline state of the neuron and what it looks like\nwhen it's modulated. And what we've observed and\nwhat has also been observed in academic work is\nthat that baseline rate, sort of the, if you're\nto target the scale, if you imagine that\nanalogy for like measuring flour or something when you're baking, that baseline state of\nhow much the pot weighs is actually different day to day. And so if what you're trying to measure is how much rice is in the pot, you're gonna get a different\nmeasurement different days, because you're measuring\nwith different pots. So that baseline rate shifting\nis really the thing that, at least from a first order\ndescription of the problem, is what's causing this downstream bias. There can be other effects, non-linear effects on top of that, but at least, at a very first order description of the problem, that's what we observe day to day is that the baseline firing\nrate of any particular neuron are observed on a\nparticular channel is changing. - So can you just adjust to the baseline to make it relative to\nthe baseline nonstop? - Yeah, this is a great question. So with monkeys, we have\nfound various ways to do this. One example way to do this is you ask them to do some behavioral task, like play the game with a joystick, you measure what's going on in the brain, you compute some mean of what's going on across\nall the input features, and you subtract it in the input when you're doing your BCI session. Works super well. For whatever reason, that doesn't work super well with Noland. I actually don't know the full reason why, but I can imagine several explanations. One such explanation could\nbe that the context effect difference between some open loop task and some closed loop task\nis much more significant with Noland than it is with a monkey. Maybe in this open loop task, he's watching the Lex Fridman podcast while he's doing the task, or he's whistling and listening to music and talking with his\nfriend and ask his mom what's for dinner while\nhe's doing this task. And so the exact sort\nof difference in context between those two states\nmay be much larger, and thus lead to a bigger\nsort of generalization gap between the features\nthat you're normalizing at sort of open loop time and what you're trying to\nuse at close loop time. - That's interesting. Just on that point,\nit's kind of incredible to watch Noland be able\nto do, to multitask, to do multiple tasks at the same time, to be able to move the\nmouse courser effectively while talking and while being nervous, because he's talking in front of- - Kicking my ass and chest too, yeah. - Kicking your ass. And talk trash while doing it. So all at the same time. And yes, if you are trying\nto normalize to the baseline, that might throw everything off. Boy is that interesting. - Maybe one comment on that too. For folks that aren't familiar\nwith assisted technology, I think there's a common belief that, well, why can't you\njust use an eye tracker or something like this\nfor helping somebody move a mouse on the screen? And it's a really a fair question, and one that I actually did was not confident before Noland, that this was gonna be a profoundly transformative technology\nfor people like him. And I'm very confident\nnow that it will be, but the reasons are subtle. It really has to do with ergonomically how it fits into their life. Even if you can just offer\nthe same level of control as what they would have\nwith an eye tracker or with a mouse stick, but you don't need to have\nthat thing in your face. You don't need to be\npositioned a certain way. You don't need your caretaker to be around to set it up for you. You can activate it when you want, how you want, wherever you want. That level of independence is\nso game changing for people. It means that they can text\na friend at night privately without their mom needing\nto be in the loop. It means that they can like open up and browse the internet at\n2:00 AM when nobody's around to set their iPad up for them. This is like a profoundly\ngame changing thing for folks in that situation. And this is even before we\nstart talking about folks that may not be able to communicate at all or ask for help when they want to. This can be potentially the only link that they have to the outside world. And yeah, that one doesn't\nI think need explanation of why that's so impactful. - You mentioned neural decoder. How much machine learning\nis in the decoder? How much magic, how much\nscience, how much art, how difficult is it to\ncome up with a decoder that figures out what these\nsequence of spikes mean? - Yeah, good question. There's a couple different\nways to answer this. So maybe I'll zoom out briefly first, and then I'll go down\none of the rabbit holes. So the zoomed out view is that building the decoder is really the process of building the dataset, plus\ncompiling it into the weights. And each of those steps is important. The direction I think\nof further improvement is primarily going to\nbe in the dataset side of how do you construct the\noptimal labels for the model. But there's an entirely separate challenge of then how do you compile the best model. And so I'll go briefly\ndown the second one, down the second rabbit hole. One of the main challenges with designing the optimal model for BCI\nis that offline metrics don't necessarily correspond\nto online metrics. It's fundamentally a control problem. The user is trying to control\nsomething on the screen, and the exact sort of user\nexperience of how you output the intention impacts\ntheir ability to control. So for example, if you just\nlook at validation loss, as predicted by your model,\nthere can be multiple ways to achieve the same validation loss. Not all of them are equally\ncontrollable by the end user. And it might be as simple as saying, \"Oh, you could just add\nauxiliary loss terms that like help you capture the\nthing that actually matters.\" But this is a very\ncomplex nuanced process. So how you turn the labels into the model is more of a nuanced process than just like a standard\nsupervised learning problem. One very fascinating anecdote here, we've tried many different\nsort of neural network architectures that translate brain data to velocity outputs, for example. And one example that's stuck in my brain from a couple years ago\nnow is, at one point, we were using just\nfully connected networks to decode the brain activity. We tried A/B test where we were measuring the relative performance\nin online control sessions of sort of 1D convolution\nover the input signal. So if you imagine per channel,\nyou have a sliding window that's producing some Commvault feature for each of those input sequences for every single channel simultaneously. You can actually get\nbetter validation metrics, meaning you're fitting the data better, and it's generalizing\nbetter on offline data if you use this\nconvolutional architecture. You're reducing parameters. It's sort of a standard procedure when you're dealing with time series data. Now it turns out that when\nusing that model online, the controllability was worse, was far worse, even though the\noffline metrics were better. And there can be many\nways to interpret that, but what that taught me at least was that, hey, it's at least the case right now that if you were to just throw a bunch of computer at this problem, and you were trying to sort\nof hyper parameter optimize, or let some GPT model hard code or come up with or invent\nmany different solutions, if you were just optimizing for loss, it would not be sufficient, which means that there's still some inherent modeling gap here. There's still some artistry\nleft to be uncovered here of how to get your model\nto scale with more compute. And that may be fundamentally\nlabeling problem, but there may be other\ncomponents to this as well. - Is it data constrained at this time? Which is what it sounds like. How do you get a lot of good labels? - Yeah, I think it's\ndata quality constrained, not necessarily data quantity constrained. - But even like even just a quantity. I mean, 'cause it has to be\ntrained on the interactions. I guess there's not\nthat many interactions. - Yeah, so it depends what version of this you're talking about. So if you're talking about like, let's say the simplest\nexample of just 2D velocity, then I think, yeah, data\nquality is the main thing. If you're talking about how to build a sort of multifunction output that lets you do all the inputs, the computer that you and I can do, then it's actually a much more sophisticated nuanced modeling challenge, because now you need to think about not just when the user's left clicking, but when you're building\nthe left click model, you also need to be thinking about how to make sure it doesn't fire when they're trying to right click or when they're trying to move the mouse. So one example of an interesting bug from like sort of week one\nof a BCI with Nolan was, when he moved the mouse, the click signal sort\nof dropped off a cliff, and when he stopped, the\nclick signal went up. So again, there's a contamination\nbetween the two inputs. Another good example was, at\none point, he was trying to do sort of a left click and drag. And the minute he started moving, the left click signal dropped off a cliff. So again, 'cause there's\nsome contamination between the two signals, you\nneed to come up with some way to either in the dataset or in the model, build robustness against this kind of, you think of it like\noverfitting, but really, it's just that the model has not seen this kind of variability before. So you need to find some way\nto help the model with that. - This is super cool because it feels like all of this is very\nsolvable, but it's hard. - Yes, it is fundamentally\nan engineering challenge. This is important to emphasize, and it's also important to emphasize that it may not need\nfundamentally new techniques, which means that people\nwho work on, let's say, unsupervised speech classification using CTC loss, for example,\nwith internal to Siri, they could potentially have\nvery applicable skills to this. - So what things are you excited about in the future development of the software stack on Neuralink? So everything we've been talking about, the decoding, the UX- - I think there's some I'm excited about, like something I'm excited\nabout from the technology side, and some I'm excited\nabout for understanding how this technology is\ngoing to be best situated for entering the world. So I'll work backwards. On the technology entering\nthe world side of things, I'm really excited to\nunderstand how this device works for folks that cannot speak at all. They have no ability to\nsort of bootstrap themselves into useful control by\nvoice command, for example, and are extremely limited in\ntheir current capabilities. I think that will be an\nincredibly useful signal for us to understand, I mean, really\nwhat is an existential threat for all startups, which\nis product market fit. Does this device have the capacity and potential to transform people's lives in the current state? And if not, what are the gaps? And if there are gaps, how do we solve them most efficiently? So that's what I'm very\nexcited about for the next sort of year or so of\nclinical trial operations. The technology side, I'm quite excited about\nbasically everything we're doing. I think it's gonna be awesome. The most prominent one, I would say, is scaling channel count. So right now, we have a\nthousand channel device. The next version, we'll have\nbetween 3 and 6,000 channels. And I would expect that curve\nto continue in the future. And it's unclear what set of problems will just disappear\ncompletely at that scale, and what set of problems will remain and require for their focus. And so I'm excited about\nthe clarity of gradient that that gives us in terms\nof the user experiences we choose to focus our\ntime and resources on. And also in terms of the, yeah, even things as simple as not stationary. Like does that problem just completely go away at that scale, or do we need to come\nup with new creative UXs still even at that point? And also, when we get to that time point, when we start expanding out dramatically the set of functions that you\ncan output from one brain, how to deal with all the nuances\nof both the user experience of not being able to\nfeel the different keys under your fingertips, but\nstill needing to be able to modulate all of them in synchrony to achieve the thing you want. And again, you don't have that appropriate set to feedback loop,\nso how can you make that intuitive for a user to control a high dimensional control surface without feeling the thing physically? I think that's gonna be a\nsuper interesting problem. I'm also quite excited to understand, do these scaling laws continue? Like as you scale channel count, how much further out do you go before that saturation point is truly hit? And it's not obvious today. I think we only know what's in the sort of interpolation space. We only know what's\nbetween zero and 1,024. We don't know what's beyond that. And then there's a whole sort of like range of interesting sort of neuroscience and brain questions, which\nis when you stick more stuff in the brain, in more places, you get to learn much more quickly about what those brain regions represent. And so I'm excited about that fundamental neuroscience learning,\nwhich is also important for figuring out how,\nand to most efficiently, insert electrodes in the future. So yeah, I think all those dimensions, I'm really, really excited about. And that doesn't even\nget close to touching the sort of software stack that\nwe work on every single day and what we're working on right now. - Yeah, it seems\nvirtually impossible to me that a thousand electrodes\nis where it saturates. It feels like this would be one of those silly notions in the\nfuture, where obviously, you should have millions of electrodes, and this is where like the\ntrue breakthroughs happen. - Yeah. - You tweeted-\n- Oh. - \"Some thoughts are most\nprecisely described in poetry.\" Why do you think that is? - I think it's because\nthe information bottleneck of language is pretty steep. And yet you're able to reconstruct in the other person's\nbrain more effectively without being literal. If you can express a sentiment\nsuch that in their brain, they can reconstruct the\nactual true underlying meaning and beauty of the thing that you're trying to get across. The sort of the generator function in their brain's more powerful than what language can express. And so the mechanism of\npoetry is really just to feed or seed that generator function. - So being literal sometimes\nis a suboptimal compression for the thing you're trying to convey. - And it's actually in\nthe process of the user going through that generation that they understand what you mean. That's the beautiful part. It's also like when you look\nat a beautiful painting, like it's not the pixels of the\npainting that are beautiful, it's the thought process that\noccurs when you see that, the experience of that. That actually is a thing that matters. - Yeah, it's resonating with some deep- - [Bliss] Yeah. - Thing within you that\nthe artist also experienced and was able to convey\nthat through the pixels. And that's actually gonna be\nrelevant for full on telepathy. It's like if you just read\nthe poetry, literally, that doesn't say much\nof anything interesting. It requires a human to interpret it. So it's the combination of the human mind and all the experiences\nthat human being has within the context of the\ncollective intelligence of the human species that\nmakes that poem make sense. And they load that in. And so in that same way,\nthe signal that carries from human to human\nmeaning may seem trivial, but may actually carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind on the receiving end. Yeah, that's interesting. Poetry still doesn't, who is it? I think Yoshi Bako first said something about all the people that think we've achieved AGI explain\nwhy humans like music. - [Bliss] Oh yeah. - And until the AGI likes music, you haven't achieved AGI or something like this.\n- Do you not think that's like some next\ntoken entropy surprise kind of thing going on there? - I don't know.\n- I don't know either. I listen to a lot of classical music and also read a lot of poetry. And yeah, I do wonder if\nlike there is some element of the next token surprise\nfactor going on there. - Yeah, maybe.\n- Because I mean, like a lot of the tricks\nin both poetry and music are like basically, you have\nsome repeated structure. And then you do like a twist. It's like, okay, verse or\nlike clause one, two, three is one thing, and then\nclause four is like, okay, now we're onto the next theme. And they kind of play with\nexactly when the surprise happens and the expectation of the user. And that's even true like, through history as musicians evolve music, they take like some nuanced structure that people are familiar with and they just tweak it a little bit. Like they tweak it and\nadd a surprising element. This is especially true in\nclassical music heritage. But that's what I'm wondering,\nlike is it all just entropy- - So breaking structure\nor breaking symmetry is something that humans seem to like. Maybe as simple as that. - Yeah, and I mean, great artists copy, and they also, knowing\nwhich rules to break is the important part. And that fundamentally, it must be about the listener of the piece. Like which rule is the right one to break, it's about the user or the audience member perceiving that as interesting. - What do you think is the\nmeaning of human existence? - There's a TV show I really\nlike called \"The West Wing.\" And in \"The West Wing,\"\nthere's a character. He's the president of the United States who's having a discussion about the Bible with one of their colleagues. And the colleague says something about, \"The Bible says X, Y, and Z.\" And the President says, \"Yeah,\nbut it also says A, B, C.\" And the person says, \"Do you believe the Bible\nto be literally true?\" And the President says,\n\"Yes, but I also think that neither of us are smart\nenough to understand it.\" I think the analogy here\nfor the meaning of life is that largely, we don't know\nthe right question to ask. And so I think I'm very aligned with sort of \"The Hitchhiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy\" version of this question, which is basically, if we can ask the right questions, it's much more likely we find the meaning of human existence. And so in the short term, as a heuristic in the sort\nof search policy space, we should try to increase the diversity of people asking such questions, or generally of consciousness and conscious beings\nasking such questions. So again, I think I'll take\nthe 'I don't know card' here, but say I do think there are\nmeaningful things we can do that improve the likelihood\nof answering that question. - It's interesting how\nmuch value you assign to the task of asking the right questions. That's the main thing is not the answers, it's the questions. - This point by the way is driven home in a very painful way when\nyou try to communicate with someone who cannot speak,\nbecause a lot of the time, the last thing to go is\nthey have the ability to somehow wiggle a lip or move something that allows them to say yes or no. And in that situation, it's very obvious that what matters is, are you asking them the right question to be\nable to say yes or no to? - Wow, that's powerful. Well, Bliss, thank you\nfor everything you do, and thank you for being you, and thank you for talking today. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bliss Chapman. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Noland Arbaugh, the first human being to\nhave a Neuralink device implanted in his brain. You had a diving accident in\n2016 that left you paralyzed with no feeling from the shoulders down. How did that accident change your life? - That's sort of a freak\nthing that happened. Imagine you're running into the ocean, although this is a lake, but\nyou're running into the ocean and you get to about waist high, and then you kind of like dive in, take the rest of the plunge\nunder the wave or something. That's what I did. And then I just never came back up. Not sure what happened. I did it running into the\nwater with a couple of guys. And so my idea of what happened is really just that I\ntook like a stray fist, elbow, knee, foot, something\nto the side of my head. The left side of my head was sore for about a month afterwards. So must must've taken a pretty big knock. And then they both came up, and I didn't. And so I was face down\nin the water for a while. I was conscious. And then eventually just realized I couldn't hold my breath any longer. And I keep saying, \"Took a big drink.\" People, I don't know if\nthey like that I say that. It seems like I'm making light of it all, but it's just kind of how I am. And I don't know, like I'm a very relaxed sort of stress-free person. I rolled with the punches\nfor a lot of this. I kind of took it in stride. It's like, \"All right,\nwell what can I do next? How can I improve my\nlife even a little bit on a day-to-day basis?\" At first, just trying\nto find some way to heal as much of my body as possible, to try to get healed, to\ntry to get off a ventilator, learn as much as I could\nso I could somehow survive once I left the hospital. And then thank God I had\nlike my family around me. If I didn't have my parents, my siblings, then I would've never made it this far. They've done so much for me, more than like I can ever\nthank them for, honestly. And a lot of people don't have that. A lot of people in my situation, their families either aren't\ncapable of providing for them, or honestly, just don't want to. And so they get placed\nsomewhere in some sort of home. So thankfully I had my family. I have a great group of friends, a great group of buddies from college who have all rallied around me, and we're all still incredibly close. People always say, \"If you're lucky, you'll end up with one or\ntwo friends from high school that you keep throughout your life.\" I have about 10 or 12 from high school that have all stuck around, and we still get together,\nall of us twice a year. We call it the spring\nseries and the fall series. This last one we all did,\nwe dressed up like X-Men. So I did a Professor Xavier,\nand it was freaking awesome. It was so good. So yeah, I have such a great\nsupport system around me. And so being a quadriplegic\nisn't that bad. I get waited on all the time. People bring me food and\ndrinks, and I get to sit around and watch as much TV and\nmovies and anime as I want. I get to read as much as I want. I mean, it's great. - It's beautiful to see that you see the silver lining in all of this. Just going back, do\nyou remember the moment when you first realized you were paralyzed from the neck down?\n- Yeah, yep. I was face down in the water right when whatever something hit my head. I tried to get up and I\nrealized I couldn't move and it just sort of clicked. I'm like, \"All right, I'm paralyzed. Can't move. What do I do? If I can't get up, I can't flip over, can't do anything, then I'm\ngonna drown eventually.\" And I knew I couldn't\nhold my breath forever, so I just held my breath\nand thought about it for maybe 10, 15 seconds. I've heard from other people\nthat like look on liquors, I guess the two girls that\npulled me out of the water were two of my best friends. They're lifeguards. And one of them said that\nit looked like my body was sort of shaking in the water, like I was trying to flip over and stuff. But I knew, I knew immediately. And I just kind of, I realized that that's\nwhat my situation was from here on out. Maybe if I got to the hospital, they'd be able to do something. When I was in the hospital, like right before surgery, I was trying to calm\none of my friends down. I had like brought her with\nme from college to camp, and she was just bawling\nover me, and I was like, \"Hey, it's gonna be fine. Like don't worry.\" I was cracking some jokes\nto try to lighten the mood. The nurse had called\nmy mom, and I was like, \"Don't tell my mom. She's just gonna be stressed out. Call her after I'm out of surgery,\" 'cause at least she'll\nhave some answers then, like whether I live or not, really. And I didn't want her to be stressed through the whole thing. But I knew. And then when I first\nwoke up after surgery, I was super drugged up. They had me on fentanyl like\nthree ways, which was awesome. I don't recommend it, but\nI saw some crazy stuff on that fentanyl, and it was still the best I've ever felt on drugs. Medication, sorry, on medication. And I remember the first time\nI saw my mom in the hospital. I was just bawling. I had like ventilator in, like I couldn't talk or anything, and I just started crying, because it was more like seeing her. I mean, the whole situation\nobviously was pretty rough, but it was just like seeing her face for the first time was pretty hard. But yeah, I never had like a moment of, \"Man, I'm paralyzed. This sucks. I don't wanna like be around anymore.\" It was always just, \"I hate\nthat I have to do this, but like sitting here and\nwallowing isn't gonna help.\" - So immediate acceptance. - [Noland] Yeah, yeah. - Has there been low points along the way? - Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, there are days\nwhen I don't really feel like doing anything. Not so much anymore. Like not for the last couple years, I don't really feel that way. I've more so just wanted to\ntry to do anything possible to make my life better at this point. But at the beginning, there\nwere some ups and downs. There were some really\nhard things to adjust to. First off, just like\nthe first couple months, the amount of pain I was\nin was really, really hard. I mean, I remember screaming at the top of my lungs in the hospital, because I thought my legs were on fire. And obviously, I can't feel anything, but it's all nerve pain. And so that was a really hard night. I asked them to give me as\nmuch pain meds as possible. They're like, \"You've had\nas much as you can have, so just kind of deal with it. Go to a happy place sort of thing.\" So that was a pretty low point. And then every now and again, it's hard, like realizing things that\nI wanted to do in my life that I won't be able to do anymore. I always wanted to be\na husband and father, and I just don't think\nthat I could do it now as a quadriplegic. Maybe it's possible, but\nI'm not sure I would ever put someone I love through that, like having to take care of me and stuff. Not being able to go out and play sports. I was a huge athlete growing\nup, so that was pretty hard. Little things too, when I\nrealized I can't do them anymore. Like there's something really special about being able to hold\na book and smell a book. Like the feel, the texture, the smell, like as you turn the\npages, like I just love it. I can't do it anymore. And it's little things like that. The two-year mark was pretty rough. Two years is when they say\nyou will get back basically as much as you're ever gonna get back, as far as movement and sensation goes. And so for the first two years, that was the only thing\non my mind was like try as much as I can to move my fingers, my hands, my feet, everything possible to try to get sensation and movement back. And then when the two-year mark hit, so June 30th, 2018, I was really sad that\nthat's kind of where I was. And then just randomly here and there, but I was never like depressed\nfor long periods of time. Just it never seemed worthwhile to me. - What gave you strength? - My faith. My faith in God was a big one. My understanding that it\nwas all for a purpose. And even if that purpose wasn't anything involving Neuralink,\neven if that purpose was, there's a story in the Bible about Job, and I think it's a really,\nreally popular story, about how Job has all\nof these terrible things happen to him, and he praises God throughout the whole situation. I thought, and I think\na lot of people think for most of their lives that they are Job, that they're the ones going\nthrough something terrible, and they just need to praise\nGod through the whole thing and everything will work out. At some point after my accident, I realized that I might not be Job, that I might be one of his children that gets killed or\nkidnapped or taken from him. And so it's about terrible\nthings that happen to those around you who you love. So maybe, in this case,\nmy mom would be Job, and she has to get through\nsomething extraordinarily hard and I just need to try and make it as best as possible for her, because she's the one that's really going through this massive trial. And that gave me a lot of strength. And obviously, my family. My family and my friends, they give me all the strength that I need on a day-to-day basis. So it makes things a lot easier having that great\nsupport system around me. - From everything I've seen of you online, your streams and the way you\nare today, I really admire, let's say, your unwavering\npositive outlook on life. Has that always been this way? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've just always thought I could do anything I ever wanted to do. There was never anything too big. Like whatever I set my mind\nto, I felt like I could do it. I didn't wanna do a lot. I wanted to like travel around and be sort of like a gypsy\nand like go work odd jobs. I had this dream of\ntraveling around Europe and being like, I don't know, a shepherd in like Wales or Ireland. And then going and being\na fisherman in Italy, doing all these things for like a year. Like it's such like cliche things, but I just thought it would be so much fun to go and travel and do different things. And so I've always just seen the best in people around me too. And I've always tried\nto be good to people. And growing up with my mom too, she's like the most positive\nenergetic person in the world. And we're all just people people. I just get along great with people. I really enjoy meeting new people, and so I just wanted to do everything. This is just kind of just how I've been. - It's just great to see that\ncynicism didn't take over, given everything you've been through. - Yeah. - Was that like a\ndeliberate choice you made that you're not gonna\nlet this keep you down? - Yeah, a bit. Also, like it's just kind of how I am. Like I said, I roll with\nthe punches with everything. I always used to tell people, like I don't stress about things much. And whenever I'd see\npeople getting stressed, I would just say, \"It's not hard. Just don't stress about it.\" And that's all you need to do. And they're like, \"That's\nnot how that works.\" I'm like, \"It works for me. Like just don't stress, and\neverything will be fine. Like everything will work out.\" Obviously, not everything\nalways goes well, and it's not like it all works out for the best all the time, but I just don't think stress has had any place in my life since I was a kid. - What was the experience like of you being selected to\nbe the first human being to have a Neuralink device\nimplanted in your brain? Were you scared, excited?\n- No, no, it was cool. (Lex laughing) Like I was never afraid of it. I had to think through a lot. Should I do this? Like be the first person? I could wait until number two or three and get a better version of the Neuralink. Like the first one might not work. Maybe it's actually gonna kind of suck it. It's gonna be the worst\nversion ever in a person. So why would I do the first one? Like I've already kind of been selected. I could just tell them, like,\n\"Okay, find someone else, and then I'll do number two or three.\" Like I'm sure they would let me. They're looking for a few people anyways. But ultimately, I was like, I don't know, there's something about being\nthe first one to do something. It's pretty cool. I always thought that if I had the chance that I would like to do\nsomething for the first time, this seemed like a\npretty good opportunity, and I was never scared. I think my like faith\nhad a huge part in that. I always felt like God was\npreparing me for something. I almost wish it wasn't this, because I had many conversations with God about not wanting to do any\nof this as a quadriplegic. I told him, \"I'll go\nout and talk to people. I'll go out and travel the world and talk to stadiums, thousands of people, give my testimony, I'll do all of it, but like heal me first. Don't make me do all of this in a chair. That sucks.\" And I guess he won that argument. I didn't really have much of a choice. I always felt like there\nwas something going on. And to see how, I guess,\neasily I made it through the interview process and how quickly everything happened, how the stars sort of\naligned with all of this, it just told me like, as the\nsurgery was getting closer, it just told me that it\nwas all meant to happen. It was all meant to be. And so I shouldn't be afraid\nof anything that's to come. And so I wasn't. I kept telling myself like, \"You say that now, but as\nsoon as the surgery comes, you're probably gonna be freaking out. Like you're about to have brain surgery.\" And brain surgery is a big\ndeal for a lot of people, but it's a even bigger deal for me. Like it's all I have left. The amount of times I've been like, \"Thank you God that you\ndidn't take my brain and my personality and\nmy ability to think, my like love of learning, like my character, everything,\nlike thank you so much. Like as long as you left me that, then I think I can get by.\" And I was about to let\npeople go like root around, and they're like, \"Hey, we're gonna go put some stuff in your brain. Hopefully, it works out.\" And so it was something\nthat gave me pause. But like I said, how\nsmoothly everything went, I never expected for a second\nthat anything would go wrong. Plus, the more people I\nmet on the Barrow's side and on the Neuralink side, they're just the most\nimpressive people in the world. Like I can't speak enough to how much I trust\nthese people with my life and how impressed I am with all of them. And to see the excitement on their faces, to like walk into a room\nand roll into a room and see all of these people looking at me, like we're so excited. Like we've been working so hard on this, and it's finally happening. It's super infectious, and it just makes me wanna do it even more and to help them achieve their dreams. Like I don't know, it's so rewarding. And I'm so happy for\nall of them, honestly. - What was the day of surgery like? When did you wake up? What'd you feel? - Yeah.\n- Minute by minute. - Yeah.\n- Were you freaking out? - No, no. I thought I was going to, but as surgery approached\nthe night before, the morning of, I was just excited. Let's make this happen. I think I said something like that to Elon on the phone beforehand. We were like FaceTiming, and I was like, \"Let's rock and roll.\" And he's like, \"Let's do it.\" I don't know, I wasn't scared. So we woke up. I think we had to be at the\nhospital at like 5:30 AM. I think surgery was at like 7:00 AM. So we woke up pretty early. I'm not sure much of us slept that night. Got to the hospital 5:30, went through like all the pre-op stuff. Everyone was super nice. Elon was supposed to be\nthere in the morning, but something went wrong with his plane, so we ended up FaceTiming. That was cool. Had one of the greatest\none-liners of my life. After that phone call, hung up with him. There were like 20 people\naround me, and I was like, I just hope he wasn't too\nstarstruck talking to me. - Nice.\n- Yeah, it was good. - Well done.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Did you write that ahead of\ntime, or it just came to you? - No, it just came to me. I was like, \"This seems right.\" When in surgery, I asked if I could pray right beforehand. So I like prayed over the room. I asked God if you would\nlike be with my mom in case anything happened to me. And just to like calm\nher nerves out there. Woke up and played a bit\nof a prank on my mom. I don't know if you've heard about it. - Yeah, I read about it. - Yeah, she was not happy. - Can you take me through the prank - Yeah, this is something-\n- Do you regret doing that now?\n- No, no, not one bit. It was something I had talked about ahead of time with my buddy, Bain. I was like, \"I would really\nlike to play a prank on my mom.\" Very specifically, my mom. She's very gullible. I think she had knee surgery once even. And after she came out of knee surgery, she was super groggy. She's like, \"I can't feel my legs.\" And my dad looked at her, he was like, \"You don't have any legs. Like they had to amputate both your legs.\" We just do very mean\nthings to her all the time. I'm so surprised that she still loves us. But right after surgery,\nI was really worried that I was going to be too like\ngroggy, like not all there. I had anesthesia once\nbefore, and it messed me up. Like I could not function\nfor a while afterwards. And I like said a lot of\nthings that I was like, I was really worried\nthat I was gonna start, I don't know, like dropping some bombs. And I wouldn't even know,\nI wouldn't remember. So I was like, \"Please\nGod, don't let that happen. And please let me be there\nenough to do this to my mom.\" And so she walked in after surgery. It was like the first time they had been able to\nsee me after surgery. And she just looked at me, she said, \"Hi, like, how are you? How are you doing? How do you feel?\" And I looked at her in this very, I think the anesthesia helped, very like groggy, sort of\nconfused look on my face. It's like, \"Who are you?\" And she just started\nlooking around the room, like at the surgeons,\nat the doctors, like, \"What did you do to my son? You need to fix this right now.\" Tears started streaming. I saw how much she was freaking out. I was like, \"I can't let this go on.\" And so I was like, \"Mom, I'm fine. Like it's all right.\" And still, she was not happy about it. She still says she's\ngonna get me back someday. But I mean, I don't know. I don't know what that's gonna look like. - It's a lifelong battle.\n- Yeah, it was good. - In some sense, it was a demonstration that you still got- - That's all I wanted it to be\n- Sense of humor. - That's all I wanted it to be. And I knew that doing\nsomething super mean to her like that would show her-\n- - - Yeah.\n- To show that you're still there, that you love her. - [Noland] Yeah, exactly, exactly. - It's a dark way to do it, but I love it. What was the first time\nyou were able to feel that you can use the Neuralink device to effect the world around you? - Yeah, the first little taste I got of it was actually not too long after surgery. Some of the Neuralink team had brought in like a little iPad, a\nlittle tablet screen, and they had put up\neight different channels that were recording some\nof my neuron spikes. They put it in front of me. Like this is like real\ntime your brain firing. That's super cool. My first thought was, \"I\nmean, if they're firing now, let's see if I can\naffect them in some way.\" So I started trying to\nlike wiggle my fingers and I just started like\nscanning through the channels, and one of the things I was doing was like moving my index\nfinger up and down. And I just saw this yellow\nspike on like top row, like third box over or something. I saw this yellow spike\nevery time I did it. And I was like, \"Oh, that's cool.\" And everyone around me was just like, \"Well, what are you seeing?\" I was like, \"Look, look at this one. Look at like this top row, third\nbox over this yellow spike. Like that's me right there, there, there.\" And everyone was freaking out. They started like clapping. I was like, \"That's super unnecessary.\" - That's awesome.\n- This is what's supposed to happen, right? - So you're imagining yourself moving each individual finger one at a time, and then seeing like that\nyou can notice something, and then when you did the index\nfinger, you're like, \"Oh.\" - Yeah, I was wiggling\nkind of all of my fingers to see if anything would happen. There was a lot of other things going on, but that big yellow spike was\nthe one that stood out to me. Like I'm sure that if I would've\nstared at it long enough, I could have mapped out\nmaybe 100 different things. But the big yellow spike\nwas the one that I noticed. - Maybe you could speak to what it's like to sort of wiggle your fingers, to imagine that the mental,\nthe cognitive effort required to sort of wiggle your\nindex finger, for example. How easy is that to do? - Pretty easy for me. It's something that,\nat the very beginning, after my accident, they told me to try and move my body as much as possible. Even if you can't, just keep trying, because that's going to create\nnew like neural pathways or pathways in my spinal cord\nto like reconnect these things to hopefully regain some movement someday. - That's fascinating.\n- Yeah, I know. It's bizarre, but I- - So that's part of the recovery process is to keep trying to move your body? - Yep, as much as you can.\n- And that's, and the nervous system does its thing. It starts reconnecting.\n- Yeah. It'll start reconnecting for some people. Some people, it never works. Some people, they'll do it. Like for me, I got some\nbicep control back, and that's about it. I can, if I try enough, I can wiggle some of my fingers. Not like on command. It's more like if I try to move, say my right pinky and I\njust keep trying to move it, after a few seconds, it'll wiggle. So I know there's stuff there. Like I know, and that happens with a few - -different of my fingers and stuff. But yeah, that's what they tell you to do. One of the people at the time when I was in the hospital\ncame in and told me, for one guy who had recovered\nmost of his control, what he thought about every\nday was actually walking, like the act of walking\njust over and over again. So I tried that for years. I tried just imagining\nwalking, which it's hard. It's hard to imagine like all\nof the steps that go into, well, taking a step, like all of the things that have to move, like all of the activations\nthat have to happen along your leg in order\nfor one step to occur. - But you're not just imagining. You're like doing it, right? - I'm trying, yeah. So it's like, it's imagining over again what I had to do to take a step, because it's not something\nany of us think about. You wanna walk and you take a step. You don't think about all\nof the different things that are going on in your body. So I had to recreate that in\nmy head as much as I could. And then I practice it\nover and over and over. - So it's not like a\nthird person perspective. It's a first person perspective. You're like, it's not like you're imagining yourself walking. You're like literally\ndoing this, everything, all the same stuff as if you're walking. - Yeah, which was hard. It was hard at the beginning. - Like frustrating hard, or like actually cognitively hard? Like which way?\n- It was both. There's a scene in one of the\n\"Kill Bill\" movies actually, oddly enough, where she is like paralyzed, I don't know, from like a\ndrug that was in her system. And then she like finds some way to get into the back of a truck or something, and she stares at her\ntoe and she says, \"Move.\" Like move your big toe. And after a few seconds\non screen, she does it. And she did that with every\none of her like body parts until she can move again. I did that for years, just\nstared at my body and said, \"Move your index finger. Move your big toe.\" Sometimes, vocalizing it like out loud, sometimes just thinking it. I tried every different way to do this to try to get some movement back. And it's hard because it\nactually is like taxing, like physically taxing on my body, which is something I\nwould've never expected, 'cause it's not like I'm moving, but it feels like there's\na buildup of, I don't know, the only way I can describe\nit is there are like signals that aren't getting\nthrough from my brain down, 'cause there's that gap in my spinal cord. So brain down, and then from\nmy hand back up to the brain. And so it feels like those signals get stuck in whatever body\npart that I'm trying to move. And they just build up and build up and build up until they burst. And then once they burst, I\nget like this really weird sensation of everything\nsort of like dissipating back out to level, and then I do it again. It's also just like a fatigue\nthing, like a muscle fatigue, but without actually moving your muscles. It's very, very bizarre. And then if you try to\nstare at a body part or think about a body part and move for two, three,\nfour, sometimes eight hours, it's very taxing on your mind. It's takes a lot of focus. It was a lot easier at the beginning because I wasn't able to like control a TV in my room or anything. I wasn't able to control\nany of my environment. So for the first few years, a lot of what I was doing\nwas staring at walls. And so obviously, I did a lot of thinking, and I tried to move a lot just\nover and over and over again. - So you never gave up sort of hope there? - No.\n- Just training hard essentially?\n- Yep, and I still do it. I do it like subconsciously. And I think that that helped a lot with things with Neuralink, honestly. It's something that I\ntalked about the other day at the all hands that I did at\nNeuralink's Austin facility. - Welcome to Austin, by the way. - Yeah, hey, thanks man. I went to school-\n- Nice hat. - Hey, thanks, thanks man. The gigafactory was super cool. I went to school at Texas A&M, so I've been around before. - So you should be saying welcome to me. - Yeah.\n- Welcome to Texas, Lex. Yeah, I get you. - But yeah, I was talking about how a lot of what they've had me do, especially at the beginning, well, I still do it now is body mapping. So like there will be a\nvisualization of a hand or an arm on the screen and\nI have to do that motion, and that's how they sort\nof train the algorithm to like understand what I'm trying to do. And so it made things very\nseamless for me, I think. - That's really, really cool. So yeah, it's amazing to know 'cause I've learned a lot about\nthe body mapping procedure with the interface and\neverything like that. It's cool to know that\nyou've been essentially like training to be like\nworld class at that task. - Yeah, yeah. I don't know if other quadriplegics, like other paralyzed people give up. I hope they don't. I hope they keep trying, because I've heard other\nparalyzed people say, like don't ever stop. They tell you two years,\nbut you just never know. The human body is capable\nof amazing things. So I've heard other people\nsay, \"Don't give up.\" Like I think one girl had spoken to me through some family members and said that she had been\nparalyzed for 18 years, and she'd been trying to\nlike wiggle her index finger for all that time, and\nshe finally got it back like 18 years later. So like I know that it's possible, and I'll never give up doing it. I do it when I'm lying down. Like watching TV, I'll\nfind myself doing it, kind of just almost like on its own. It's just something I've\ngotten so used to doing that I don't know, I don't\nthink I'll ever stop. - That's really awesome to hear, 'cause I think it's one of those things that can really pay off, in the long term. 'Cause like that is training. You're not visibly seeing the results of that training at the moment, but like, there's that like Olympic\nlevel nervous system getting ready for something.\n- Which honestly was like something that\nI think Neuralink gave me that I can't thank them enough for it. Like I can't show my\nappreciation for it enough was being able to visually see that what I'm doing is\nactually having some effect. It's a huge part of the reason why, like I know now that I'm\ngonna keep doing it forever, because before Neuralink,\nI was doing it every day, and I was just assuming\nthat things were happening. Like it's not like I knew. I wasn't getting back any\nmobility or sensation or anything. So I could have been running up against a brick wall for all I knew. And with Neuralink, I get to see like all the signals happen in real time, and I get to see that what I'm doing can actually be mapped. When we started doing like\nclick calibrations and stuff, when I go to click my index\nfinger for a left click, that it actually recognizes that. Like it changed how I\nthink about what's possible with like retraining my body to move. And so yeah, I'll never give up now. - And also, just the signal\nthat there's still a powerhouse of a brain there that's like- - Exactly.\n- And as the technology develops, that brain is, I mean, that's the most important thing about the human body is the brain. And it can do a lot of the control. So what did it feel like when you first, could wiggle the index finger and saw the environment respond? Like that little-\n- Yeah. - Wherever, just being way\ntoo dramatic according to you. - Yeah, it was very cool. I mean, it was cool, but I\nkeep telling this to people, it made sense to me. Like it made sense that like there are signals\nstill happening in my brain, and that as long as you\nhad something near it that could measure those,\nthat could record those, then you should be able to\nvisualize it in some way. Like see it happen. And so that was not very surprising to me. I was just like, \"Oh, cool.\" We found one. Like we found something that works. It was cool to see that\ntheir technology worked, and that everything that\nthey had worked so hard for was like going to pay off. But I hadn't like moved a cursor\nor anything at that point. I had like interacted with a computer or anything at that point. So it just made sense, it was cool. I didn't really know much\nabout BCI at that point either, so I didn't know like what sort of step this was actually making. Like I didn't know if\nthis was like a huge deal, or if this was just like, okay, it's cool that we got this far, but we're actually hoping for something like much\nbetter down the road. It's like, okay. I just thought that they\nknew that it turned on. So I was like, cool. Like this is cool. - Well, did you like read up on the specs of the hardware you're getting installed? Like the number of threads, this kind of stuff?\n- Yeah, I do all of that, but it's all Greek to me. I was like, okay, threads, 64 threads, 16 electrodes, 1,024 channels. Okay. Like that math checks out. - Sounds right.\n- Yeah. - When was the first time you were able to move a mouse cursor? - I know it must have been\nwithin the first maybe week, a week or two weeks that I was able to like first move the cursor. And again, like it kind\nof made sense to me. It didn't seem like that big of a deal. It was like, okay, well, hmm, how do I explain this? When everyone around you starts clapping for something that you've\ndone, it's easy to say, \"Okay, like I did something cool. Like that was impressive in some way.\" What exactly that meant, what it was hadn't really like set in for me. So again, I knew that me\ntrying to move a body part and then that being mapped\nin some sort of like machine learning algorithm\nto be able to identify like my brain signals and then take that and give me cursor control, that all kind of made sense to me. I don't know like all\nthe ins and outs of it, but I was like, there are still\nsignals in my brain firing. They just can't get through because there's like a\ngap in my spinal cord. And so they can't get all\nthe way down and back up, but they're still there. So when I moved the cursor for\nthe first time, I was like, \"That's cool, but I expected\nthat that should happen.\" Like it made sense to me. When I moved the cursor for the first time with just my mind, without\nlike physically trying to move, so I guess I can get into\nthat just a little bit. Like the difference between attempted movement and imagined movement. - Yeah, that's a fascinating difference. - Yeah.\n- From one to the other. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like attempted movement\nis me physically trying to attempt to move, say, my hand. I try to attempt to move\nmy hand to the right, to the left, forward and back. And that's all attempted. Attempt to like lift\nmy finger up and down. Attempt to kick or something. I'm physically trying to\ndo all of those things, even if you can't see it. This would be like me attempting to like shrug my shoulders or something. That's all attempted movement. That's what I was doing for\nthe first couple of weeks when they were going to\ngive me cursor control. When I was doing body mapping, it was attempt to do\nthis, attempt to do that. When Nir was telling me\nto like imagine doing it, it like kind of made sense to me, but it's not something\nthat people practice. Like if you started school\nas a child and they said, \"Okay, write your name with this pencil.\" And so you do that. \"Okay, now imagine writing\nyour name with that pencil.\" Kids would think like, I guess like that kind of makes sense. And they would do it. But that's not something we're taught. It's all like how to do things physically. We think about like thought\nexperiments and things, but that's not like a physical\naction of doing things. It's more like what you would\ndo in certain situations. So imagined movement, it never\nreally connected with me. Like I guess you could maybe describe it as like a professional athlete, like swinging a baseball bat\nor swinging like a golf club. Like imagine what you're supposed to do. But then you go right to\nthat and physically do it, then you get a bat in your hand and then you do what\nyou've been imagining. And so I don't have that like connection. So telling me to imagine\nsomething versus attempting it, there wasn't a lot that I\ncould do there mentally. I just kind of had to accept\nwhat was going on and try. But the attempted moving\nthing, it all made sense to me. Like if I try to move, then there's a signal\nbeing sent in my brain. And as long as they can pick that up, then they should be able to map\nit to what I'm trying to do. And so when I first moved\nthe cursor like that, it was just like, \"Yes,\nthis should happen.\" Like I'm not surprised by that. - But can you clarify, is there\nsupposed to be a difference between imagined movement\nand attempted movement? - Yeah, just that in imagined movement, you're not attempting to move at all. - You're like visualizing doing. And then theoretically, is\nthat supposed to be a different part of the brain that lights up in those two different situations? - [Bliss] Yeah, not necessarily. I think all these signals\ncan still be represented in motor cortex, but the\ndifference I think has to do with the naturalness\nof imagining something versus attempting it-\n- Got it. - [Bliss] And sort of the\nfatigue of that over time. - And by the way, on the mic is Bliss. So this is just different\nways to prompt you to kind of get to the\nthing that you arrived at. - [Noland] Yeah, yeah. - Attempted movement does sound\nlike the right thing - try. - Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me. - 'Cause imagine for me,\nI would start visualizing, like in my mind, visualizing. Attempted, I would actually\nstart trying to like, there's, I mean, I did like combat sports my\nwhole life, like wrestling. When I'm imagining a move,\nsee, I'm like moving my muscle. - Exactly.\n- Like there is a bit of an activation almost,\nversus like visualizing yourself like a picture doing it. - Yeah, it's something that I feel like naturally, anyone would do. If you try to tell someone\nto imagine doing something, they might close their eyes and then start physically doing it. But it's just-\n- Just didn't click. - Yeah. It's hard. It was very hard at the beginning. - But attempted worked.\n- Attempted worked. It worked just like it should. Worked like a charm. - [Bliss] I remember\nthere was like one Tuesday we were messing around, and I think, I forget what swear word you used, but there's a swear word\nthat came out of your mouth when you figured out you could just do the direct cursor control. - Yeah, that's it. It blew my mind. Like no pun intended,\nblew my mind when I first moved the cursor just with my thoughts and not attempting to move. It's something that I've found like over the couple of weeks,\nlike building up to that, that as I get better cursor controls, like the model gets better, then it gets easier for me to like, like I don't have to\nattempt as much to move it. And part of that is something\nthat I'd even talked with them about when I\nwas watching the signals of my brain one day, I was watching, when I like attempted to move to the right and I watched the screen,\nit's like I saw the spikes. It's like I was seeing the\nspike, the signals being sent before I was actually attempting to move. I imagined just because when\nyou go to say move your hand or any body part, that signal gets sent before you're actually moving has to make it all the\nway down and back up before you actually do\nany sort of movement. So there's a delay there. And I noticed that there was\nsomething going on in my brain before I was actually attempting to move, that my brain was like\nanticipating what I wanted to do. And that all started sort of, I don't know, like\npercolating in my brain. It was just sort of there, like always in the back. Like that's so weird\nthat it could do that. It kind of makes sense, but\nI wonder what that means as far as like using the Neuralink. And then as I was playing around\nwith the attempted movement and playing around with the cursor, and I saw that like, as the\ncursor control got better, that it was anticipating my movements and what I wanted it to do. Like cursor movements, what I wanted to do a bit\nbetter and a bit better. And then one day, I just randomly, as I was playing Webgrid,\nI like looked at a target before I had started\nlike attempting to move. I was just trying to like get over, like train my eyes to start looking ahead. Like, okay, this is the target I'm on, but if I look over here to this target, I know I can like maybe be\na bit quicker getting there. And I looked over and the\ncursor just shot over it. It was wild. I had to take a step back. Like I was like, \"This\nshould not be happening.\" All day, I was just\nsmiling, I was so giddy. I was like, \"Guys, do\nyou know that this works? Like I can just think it and it happens,\" which like they'd all been\nsaying this entire time. like I can't believe like you're doing all this with your mind. I'm like, \"Yeah, but is\nit really with my mind?\" Like I'm attempting to move, and it's just picking that up so it doesn't feel like it's with my mind. When I moved it for the\nfirst time like that, it was, oh man. It made me think that this technology, that what I'm doing is actually way, way more impressive than I ever thought. It was way cooler than I ever thought. And it just opened up a whole\nnew world of possibilities of like what could possibly\nhappen with this technology and what I might be able\nto be capable of with it. - Because you had felt for the first time, like this was digital telepathy. Like you're controlling a\ndigital device with your mind. - [Noland] Yep. - I mean, that's a real\nmoment of discovery. That's really cool. Like you've discovered something. I've seen like scientists talk\nabout like a big aha moment. Like Nobel Prize winning, they'll have this like holy crap. - Yeah.\n- Like whoa. - That's what it felt. I didn't feel like, like I felt like I had\ndiscovered something but for me. Maybe not necessarily for\nlike the world at large or like this field at large. It just felt like an aha moment for me. Like, \"Oh this works.\" Like obviously, it works. And so that's what I do\nlike all the time now. I kind of intermix the attempted movement and imagined movement. I do it all like together, because I've found that there\nis some interplay with it that maximizes efficiency with the cursor. So it's not all like one or the other. It's not all just, I only use attempted or I only use like imagined movements. It's more I use them in parallel, and I can do one or the other. I can just completely think\nabout whatever I'm doing. But I don't know. I like to play around with it. I also like to just\nexperiment with these things. Like every now and again, I'll get this idea in my head like, \"Hmm, I wonder if this works.\" And I'll just start doing it, and then afterwards, I'll tell them, \"By the way, I wasn't doing\nthat like you guys wanted me to. I thought of something and I\nwanted to try it and so I did. It seems like it works, so maybe we should like\nexplore that a little bit.\" - So I think that discovery\nis not just for you, at least from my perspective,\nthat's the discovery for everyone else who\never uses a Neuralink that this is possible. Like I don't think this an obvious thing that this is even possible. It's like, I was saying to Bliss earlier, it's like the four-minute mile. People thought it was\nimpossible to run a mile in four minutes, and once\nthe first person did it, then everyone just started doing it. So like just to show that it's possible, that paves the way to\nlike anyone can not do it. That's the thing that's actually possible. You don't need to do\nthe attempted movement. You can just go direct. That's crazy. - It is crazy, it's crazy. - For people who don't know, can you explain how the Link app works? You have an amazing stream on the topic. Your first stream, I think,\non X describing the app. Can you just describe how it works? - Yeah, so it's just an\napp that Neuralink created to help me interact with the computer. So on the Link app, there\nare a few different settings and different modes and\nthings I can do on it. So there's like the body mapping, which we kind of touched on. There's a calibration. Calibration is how I\nactually get cursor control. So calibrating what's going on in my brain to translate that into cursor control. So it will pop out models. What they use I think is like time. So it would be five minutes, and calibration will give\nme so good of a model. And then if I'm in it for\n10 minutes and 15 minutes, the models will progressively get better. And so the longer I'm in it generally, the better the models will get. - That's really cool, 'cause\nyou often refer to the models. The model's the thing that's constructed once you go through the calibration step. And then you also talked about, sometimes you'll play like\na really difficult game, like Snake, just to see\nhow good the model is. - Yeah, yeah, so Snake is kind of like my litmus test for models. If I can control Snake decently well, then I know I have a pretty good model. So yeah, the Link app has all of those. It has Webgrid in it now. It's also how I like connect to the computer just in general. So they've given me a lot\nof like voice controls with it at this point,\nso I can say like connect or implant disconnect. And as long as I have that charger handy, then I can connect to it. So the charger is also how\nI connect to the Link app, to connect to the computer. I have to have the implant\ncharger over my head when I wanna connect to have it wake up, 'cause the implant's in hibernation mode, like always when I'm not using it. I think there's a setting to\nlike wake it up every so long. So we could set it to\nhalf an hour or five hours or something if I just want\nit to wake up periodically. So yeah, I'll like\nconnect to the Link app, and then go through all sorts of things. Calibration for the\nday, maybe body mapping. I made them give me like\na little homework tab, because I am very forgetful and I forget to do things a lot. So I have like a lot of\ndata collection things that they want me to do. - Is the body mapping part\nof the data collection, or is that also part of the- - Yeah, it is. It's something that they\nwant me to do daily, which I've been slacking on, 'cause I've been doing so much media and traveling so much. So I've been-\n- You've been super famous. - Yeah, I've been a\nterrible first candidate for how much I've been\nslacking on my homework. But yeah, it's just\nsomething that they want me to do every day to track how well the Neuralink\nis performing over time and to have something to give. I imagine to give to the FDA to create all sorts of fancy charts\nand stuff and show like, \"Hey, this is what the Neuralink, this is how it's performing\nday one versus day 90 versus day 180 and things like that. - What's the calibration step like? Is it like move left, move right? - It's a bubble game. So there will be like yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen. At first, it is open loop. So open loop, this is something that I still don't fully understand, the open loop and closed loop thing. - And me and Bliss talked for a long time about the difference between\nthe two on the technical side. - Okay.\n- So it'd be great to hear your side of the story. - Open loop is basically, I have no control over the cursor. The cursor will be moving on\nits own across the screen, and I am following by intention the cursor to different bubbles. And then the algorithm is training off of what like the signals it's\ngetting are as I'm doing this. There are a couple different\nways that they've done it. They call it center out target. So there will be a bubble in the middle and then eight bubbles around that. And the cursor will go from\nthe middle to one side. So say middle to left, back to middle, to up, to middle, like up, right. And they'll do that all\nthe way around the circle. And I will follow that\ncursor the whole time, and then it will train\noff of my intentions, what it is expecting my intentions to be throughout the whole process. - Can you actually speak to, when you say follow-\n- Yes. - You don't mean with your eyes. You mean with your intentions. - Yeah, so generally for calibration, I'm doing attempted movements, 'cause I think it works better. I think the better models, as I progress through calibration, make it easier to use imagined movements. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. So calibrated on attempted movement will create a model that\nmakes it really effective for you to then use the force? - Yes, I've tried doing calibration with imagined movement, and it just doesn't work\nas well for some reason. So that was the center out targets. There's also one where a random target will pop up on the\nscreen and it's the same. I just like move, I follow along with wherever the cursor\nis to that target, all across the screen. I've tried those with imagined movement, and for some reason,\nthe models just don't, they don't give as high level as quality when we get into closed loop. I haven't played around with it a ton, so maybe like the different ways that we're doing calibration\nnow might make it a bit better. But what I've found is there\nwill be a point in calibration where I can use imagined movement. Before that point, it doesn't really work. So if I do calibration for 45 minutes, the first 15 minutes, I\ncan't use imagined movement. It just like doesn't work for some reason. And after a certain point, I can just sort of feel it. I can tell it moves different. That's the best way I can describe it. Like it's almost as if it is anticipating what I am going to do\nagain before I go to do it. And so using attempted\nmovement for 15 minutes, at some point, I can kind of tell when I like move my\neyes to the next target that the cursor is\nstarting to like pick up. Like it's starting to understand, it's learning like what I'm going to do. - So first of all, it's really cool that, I mean, you are a true\npioneer in all of this. You're like exploring how to do every aspect of this most\neffectively, and there's just, I imagine so many lessons\nlearned from this. So thank you for being a pioneer in all these kinds of different\nlike super technical ways. And it's also cool to hear\nthat there's like a different like feeling to the experience when it's calibrated in different ways, 'cause I mean, I imagine your brain is doing something different, and that's why there's a\ndifferent feeling to it. And then trying to find the\nwords and the measurements to those feelings would\nbe also interesting. But at the end of the\nday, you can also measure that your actual performance on whether it's Snake or Webgrid, you could see like what\nactually works well. And you're saying, for\nthe open loop calibration, the attempted movement works best for now. - Yep, yep. - So the open loop, you\ndon't get the feedback that you did something. - Yeah-\n- Is that frustrating? - No, no, it makes sense to me. Like we've done it with a cursor and without a cursor in open loop. So sometimes, it's just,\nsay, for like the center out, you'll start calibration\nwith a bubble lighting up, and I push towards that bubble. And then when that bubble, when it's pushed towards\nthat bubble for say, three seconds a bubble will pop and then I come back to the middle. So I'm doing it all just by my intentions. Like that's what it's learning anyways. So it makes sense that as long as I follow what they want me to do, like\nfollow the yellow brick road, that it'll all work out. - You're full of great references. Is the bubble game fun? - Yeah, they always feel so\nbad making me do calibration. Like, \"Oh, we're about to\ndo a 40-minute calibration.\" I'm like, \"All right, do you\nguys wanna do two of them?\" Like I'm always asking to, like whatever they need,\nI'm more than happy to do. And it's not bad. Like I get to lie there or sit in my chair and like do these things\nwith some great people. I get to have great conversations. I can give them feedback. I can talk about all sorts of things. I could throw something on\non my TV in the background and kinda like split my\nattention between them. Like it's not bad at all. I don't mind it.\n- Is there a score that you get? Like can you do better on the bubble game? - No, I would love that. I would love-\n- Yeah. Writing down suggestions from Noland. - That's-\n- Make it more fun. Gamified. - Yeah, that's one thing that I really, really enjoy about Webgrid is 'cause I'm so competitive. Like the higher the BPS,\nthe higher the score, I know the better I'm doing. I think I've asked at one\npoint one of the guys, like if he could give me some\nsort of numerical feedback for calibration, like I would like to know what they're looking at. Like, \"Oh, we see like this number while you're doing calibration, and that means, at least on our end, that we think calibration is going well.\" And I would love that,\nbecause I would like to know if what I'm doing is going well or not. But then they've also told me like, \"Yeah, not necessarily like one-to-one.\" It doesn't actually mean that calibration is\ngoing well in some ways. So it's not like 100%, and they don't wanna like\nskew what I'm experiencing or want me to change things based on that. If that number isn't always accurate to like how the model will turn out or how like the end result, that's at least what I got from it. One thing I do that I have asked them and something that I\nreally enjoy striving for is towards the end of calibration, there is like a time between targets. And so I like to keep, like at the end, that\nnumber as low as possible. So at the beginning,\nit can be four or five, six seconds between me popping bubbles. But towards the end, I like\nto keep it below like 1.5. Or if I could, get it to like one second between like bubbles, because in my mind, that translates really nicely\nto something like Webgrid where I know if I can hit\na target one every second that I'm doing real, real well. - There you go, that's a way to get a score on the calibrations. Like the speed, how quickly can you get from bubble to bubble.\n- Yeah. - So there's the open loop, and then it goes to the closed loop. - Closed loop.\n- The closed loop can already start giving you a sense, 'cause you're getting feedback of like how good the model is. - Yeah, so closed loop is when\nI first get cursor control and how they've described it to me, someone who does not\nunderstand this stuff, I am the dumbest person in the room every time I'm with-\n- I love the humility. - Yeah, is that I am closing the loop. So I am actually now the\none that is like finishing the loop of whatever this loop is. I don't even know what the\nloop is, they've never told me. They just say there is a loop. And at one point, it's\nopen and I can't control. And then I get control and it's closed. So I'm finishing the loop. - So how long the\ncalibration usually take? You said like 10, 15 minutes. - Well, yeah, they're trying to get that number down pretty low. That's what we've been\nworking on a lot recently is getting that down as low\nas possible, so that way, if this is something that people\nneed to do on a daily basis or if some people need to do on a like every other\nday basis or once a week, they don't want people to\nbe sitting in calibration for long periods of time. I think they've wanted to get it down seven minutes or below, at\nleast where we're at right now. It'd be nice if you never\nhad to do calibration. So we'll get there at\nsome point, I'm sure, the more we learn about the brain and like I think that's the dream. I think right now, for me to get like really,\nreally good models, I am in calibration 40 or 45 minutes. And I don't mind. Like I said, they always feel really bad, but if it's gonna get me a model that can like break\nthese records on Webgrid, I'll stay in it for flipping two hours. - Let's talk business. So Webgrid. I saw a presentation\nwhere Bliss said by March, you selected 89,000 targets in Webgrid. Can you explain this game? What is Webgrid, and what does it take to be a world class performer in Webgrid, as you continue to break world records? - Yeah. - It's like a gold medalist, like well. - Yeah, I'd like to thank, I'd like to thank everyone\nwho's helped me get here, my coaches, my parents for\ndriving me to practice every day at five in the morning. Like to thank God. And just overall, my\ndedication to my craft. - The interviews with athletes, they're always like that, it's like that template. - Yeah. - So Webgrid is a grid that sells.\n- Webgrid is, yeah. It's literally just a grid. They can make it as big or\nsmall as you can make a grid. A single box on that grid will light up and you go and click it. And it is a way for them to\nbenchmark how good a BCI is. So it's pretty straightforward. You just click targets. - [Lex] Only one blue cell appears, and you're supposed to move the mouse to there and click on it.\n- Yep. So I like playing on like bigger grids, 'cause the bigger the\ngrid, the like more BPS. It's bits per second that you\nget every time you click one. So I'll say, I'll play\non like a 35 by 35 grid, and then one of those little squares cell, we call it target, whatever, will light up and you\nmove the cursor there and you click it and\nthen you do that forever. - And you've been able to achieve at first eight bits per second. And then you recently broke that. - Yeah, I'm at 8.5 right now. I would've beaten that literally the day before I came to Austin. But I had like, I don't know, like a five second lag right at the end. And I just had to wait until\nthe latency calmed down and then I kept clicking. But I was at like 8.01 and\nthen five seconds of lag, and then the next like\nthree targets I clicked all stayed at 8.01. So if I would've been able to\nclick during that time of lag, I probably would've hit, I\ndon't know, I might've hit nine. So I'm there. I'm really close. And then this whole Austin trip has really gotten in the way of my Webgrid playing ability.\n- It's frustrating. - Yeah, it's-\n- So that's all you've been thinking about right now? - Yeah, I know. I want to do better at nine. I want to do better. I wanna hit nine, I think. Well, I know nine is\nvery, very achievable. I'm right there. I think 10 I could hit\nmaybe in the next month. Like I could do it probably in the next few weeks if I really push it. - I think you and Elon are\nbasically the same person, 'cause last time I did a podcast with him, he came in extremely frustrated that he can't beat Uber Lilith as a droid. That was like a year ago I\nthink, I forget, like solo. And I could just tell, there's\nsome percentage of his brain the entire time was thinking like, \"I wish I was right now attempting.\" - I think he did it. - He did it that night.\n- Yeah. - He stayed up and did it that night. It's just crazy to me. I mean, in a fundamental\nway, it's really inspiring. And what you're doing is\ninspiring in that way, 'cause I mean, it's not\njust about the game. Everything you're doing there has impact. By striving to do well on Webgrid, you're helping everybody figure out how to create the system all along, like the decoding, the\nsoftware, the hardware, the calibration, all of it, how to make all of that work so you can do everything else really well. - Yeah, it's just really fun. - Well, that's also,\nthat's part of the thing is like making it fun. - Yeah, it's addicting. I've joked about like\nwhat they actually did when they went in and put\nthis thing in my brain. They must have flipped a switch to make me more susceptible\nto these kinds of games, to make me addicted to\nlike Webgrid or something. Do you know Bliss's high score? - Yeah, he said like 14 or something. - 17.\n- Oh boy. - 17.1 or something, 17.01. - 17 dot, 17.01.\n- Yeah. - He told me he like does it on the floor with peanut butter and he like fasts. It's weird. That sounds like cheating. Sounds like performance enhancing. - [Bliss] No, like the first\ntime Noland played this game, he asked, \"How good are we at this game?\" And I think you told me right then, \"You're gonna try to beat me on that.\" - I'm gonna get there someday.\n- Yeah. I fully believe you.\n- I think I can. - I'm excited for that.\n- Yeah. So I've been playing, first\noff, with the dwell cursor, which really hampers my\nWebgrid playing ability. Basically, I have to wait\n0.3 seconds for every click. - Oh, so you can't do the clicks. So you click by dwelling, you said 0.3? - 0.3 seconds, which sucks. It really slows down how much I'm able to, like how high I'm able to get. I still hit like 50, I think I hit like 50 something trials, net\ntrials per minute in that, which was pretty good,\n'cause I'm able to like, there's one of the settings is also like how slow you need to be moving in order to initiate a\nclick, to start a click. So I can tell sort of\nwhen I'm on that threshold to start initiating a\nclick just a bit early, so I'm not fully stopped over\nthe target when I go to click. I'm doing it like on my\nway to the targets a little to try to time it just right.\n- Oh wow. So you're slowing down. - Yeah, just a hair\nright before the targets. (Lex laughing) - This is like elite performance, okay. But that's still, it sucks that there's\na ceiling of the 0.3. - Well, I can get down to 0.2 and 0.1. Point one's what-\n- I get it. - Yeah, and I've played\nwith that a little bit too. I have to adjust a ton\nof different parameters in order to play with 0.1, and I don't have control\nover all that on my end yet. It also changes like how\nthe models are trained. Like if I train a model like in Webgrid, like I bootstrap on a model,\nwhich basically is them training models as I'm playing Webgrid based off of like the Webgrid data, so like if I play Webgrid for 10 minutes, they can train off that data specifically in order to get me a better model. If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1, the models come out different. The way that they interact\nis just much, much different. So I have to be really careful. I found that doing it with 0.3 is actually better in some ways, unless I can do it with 0.1 and change all of the\ndifferent parameters, then that's more ideal, 'cause obviously, 0.3 is faster than 0.1. So I could get there. I can get there. - Can you click using your brain? - For right now, it's the hover clicking with the dwell cursor. Before all the thread\nretraction stuff happened, we were calibrating clicks\n- left click, right click. That was my previous ceiling. Before I broke the record\nagain with the dwell cursor was I think on a 35 by 35 grid\nwith left and right click. And you get more BPS, more bits per second using multiple clicks\n'cause it's more difficult. - Oh, because what is it, you're supposed to do either a left click or a like right click? You use a different color\nfor stuff like this? - Yeah, blue targets for left click; orange targets for right\nclick is what they had done. - Got it.\n- So my previous record of 7.5 was with the blue and\nthe orange targets, yeah, which I think if I went back to that now doing the click calibration, and being able to like\ninitiate clicks on my own, I think I would would\nbreak that 10 ceiling like in a couple days max. - Like yeah, you would\nstart making Bliss nervous about his 17-\n- You should be. - Why do you think we\nhaven't given him the- - Yeah, exactly. So what did it feel like\nwith the retractions? That some of the threads retracted? - It sucked. It was really, really hard. The day they told me was the\nday of my big Neuralink tour at their Fremont\nfacility, and they told me like right before we went over there. It was really hard to hear. My initial reaction was,\n\"Alright, go in, fix it. Like go in, take it out, and fix it.\" The first surgery was so easy. Like I went to sleep. A couple hours later, I\nwoke up and here we are. I didn't feel any pain, didn't take like any\npain pills or anything. So I just knew that if they\nwanted to, they could go in and put in a new one like next\nday if that's what it took, 'cause I wanted it to be better and I wanted not to lose the capability. I had so much fun playing with it for a few weeks, for a month. It had opened up so many doors for me. It had opened up so\nmany more possibilities that I didn't want to\nlose it after a month. I thought it would've\nbeen a cruel twist of fate if I had gotten to see the view from like the top of this mountain and then have it all come\ncrashing down after a month. And I knew like, say,\nthe top of the mountain, but how I saw it was I was just now starting to climb the mountain. There was so much more\nthat I knew was possible. And so to have all of that be taken away was really, really hard. But then on the drive\nover to the facility, I don't know, like five\nminute drive, whatever it is, I talked with my parents about it. I prayed about it. I was just like, \"I'm not\ngonna let this ruin my day. I'm not gonna let this\nruin this amazing like tour that they have set up for me. Like I wanna go show everyone how much I appreciate all\nthe work they're doing. I wanna go like meet all of the people who have made this possible, and I wanna go have one of\nthe best days of my life.\" And I did, and it was amazing, and it absolutely was one of the best days I've ever been privileged to experience. And then for a few days, I\nwas pretty down in the dumps. But for like the first few days\nafterwards, I was just like, I didn't know if it was\ngonna ever gonna work again. I made the decision that\neven if I lost the ability to use the Neuralink, even if I lost, even if I like lost out\non everything to come, if I could keep giving\nthem data in any way, then I would do that. If I needed to just do like some of the data collection every day or body mapping every day for\na year, then I would do it, because I know that everything I'm doing helps everyone to come after me. And that's all I wanted. I guess the whole reason that\nI did this was to help people, and I knew that anything\nI could do to help, I would continue to do, even if I never got to\nuse the cursor again, then I was just happy to be a part of it. And everything that I'd\ndone was just a perk. It was something that I got to experience, and I know how amazing it's gonna be for everyone to come after me. So might as well just keep trucking along. - Well, that said, you were able to get to work your way up, to\nget the performance back. So this is like going from\nrocky one to rocky two. So when did you first realize\nthat this is possible, and what gave you sort of the strength and motivation, determination to do it? To increase back up and\nbeat your previous record? - Yeah, it was within a couple weeks. - Again, this feels like I'm interviewing an athlete. (laughs) This is great. I like to thank my parents. - The road back was long and hard, fraught many difficulties. There were dark days. It was a couple weeks, I think. And then there was just a turning point. I think they had switched\nhow they were measuring the neuron spikes in my brain. Bliss, help me out. - [Bliss] Yeah, the way\nin which we're measuring the behavior of individual neurons. - Yeah.\n- So we're switching from sort of individual spike detection to something called spike band power, which if you watch the previous segments with either me or DJ, you\nprobably have some content. - Yeah, okay, so when they\ndid that, it was kind of like, a light over the head,\nlike light bulb moment. Like, \"Oh, this works.\" And this seems like we can run with this. And I saw the uptick in\nperformance immediately. Like I could feel it\nwhen they switched over. I was like, \"This is better. Like this is good.\" Like everything up till this point for the last few weeks, last like whatever, three or four weeks, 'cause it was before they even told me, like everything before this sucked. Like let's keep doing\nwhat we're doing now. And at that point, it was not like, \"Oh, I know I'm still only at, like saying Webgrid terms, like four or five BPS\ncompared to my 7.5 before. But I know that if we keep doing this, then like I can get back there.\" And then they gave me the dwell cursor, and the dwell cursor sucked at first. It's not, obviously, not what I want, but it gave me a path forward to be able to continue using it, and hopefully, to continue to help out. And so I just ran with\nit, never looked back. Like I said, I'm just kind of person that roll with the punches anyways. - What was the process? What was the feedback\nloop on the figuring out how to do the spike detection in a way that would actually\nwork well for Noland? - Yeah, it's a great question. So maybe just describe first\nhow the actual update worked. It was basically an\nupdate to your implant. So we just did an over\nthe air software update to his implants, same way\nyou'd update your Tesla or your iPhone, and that\nfirmware change enabled us to record sort of averages of populations of neurons nearby individual electrodes. So we have sort of less resolution about which individual\nneuron is doing what, but we have a broader\npicture of what's going on nearby an electrode overall. And that feedback, I mean, basically, Noland described it was immediate when we flipped that switch. I think the first day we did that, you had three or four\nBPS right out of the box. And that was a light bulb moment for, \"Okay, this is the right path to go down.\" And from there, there's\na lot of feedback around like how to make this\nuseful for independent use. So what we care about ultimately is that you can use it independently\nto do whatever you want. And to get to that point, it required us to re-engineer the UX, as you\ntalked about the dwell cursor, to make it something that\nyou can use independently without us needing to be\ninvolved all the time. And yeah, this is obviously the\nstart of this journey still. Hopefully, we get back to\nthe places where you're doing multiple clicks and using that to control much more fluidly, everything, and much more naturally, the applications that you're trying to interface with. - And most importantly,\nget that Webgrid number up. - Yes.\n- Yeah. So how is the, on the hover click, do you accidentally click cells sometimes? Like how hard is it to\navoid accidentally clicking? - I have to continuously\nkeep it moving, basically. So like I said, there's a threshold where it will initiate a click. So if I ever drop below that, it'll start, and I have 0.3 seconds to move\nit before it clicks anything. And if I don't want it to ever get there, I just keep it moving at a certain speed, and like just constantly\nlike doing circles on screen, moving it back and forth to\nkeep it from clicking stuff. I actually noticed a couple weeks back, when I was not using the implant, I was just moving my hand\nback and forth or in circles. Like I was trying to keep\nthe cursor from clicking, and I was just doing it\nlike while I was trying to go to sleep, and I was like,\n\"Okay, this is a problem.\" (both laughing) - To avoid the clicking. I guess, does that create\nproblems like when you're gaming accidentally click a thing? - Yeah, yeah, it happens in chess. I've lost a number of games because I'll accidentally click something. - [Bliss] I think the\nfirst time I ever beat you was because of an accident.\n- Yeah, I misclicked, yeah. - It's a nice excuse, right? - Yeah.\n- You can always, anytime you lose-\n- You could just say- - That was accidental.\n- Yeah. - You said the app improved\na lot from version one. When you first started using\nit, it was very different. So can you just talk\nabout the trial and error that you went through with the team? Like 200 plus pages of notes. What's that process like of- - Yeah.\n- Going back and forth and working together to improve the thing? - It's a lot of me just using\nit like day in and day out and saying, like, \"Hey, can\nyou guys do this for me? Like give me this. I wanna be able to do that. I need this.\" I think a lot of it just\ndoesn't occur to them maybe until someone is actually using the app, using the implant. It's just something that they just never would've thought of. Or it's very specific to even like me, maybe what I want. It's something I'm a little worried about with the next people that come is maybe they will want\nthings much different than how I've set it up, or what the advice I've given the team. And they're gonna look\nat some of the things they've added for me. Like that's a dumb idea. Like why would he ask for that? And so I'm really looking\nforward to get the next people on because I guarantee that\nthey're going to think of things that I've never thought of. They're gonna think of improvements. I'm like, \"Wow, that's a really good idea. Like I wish I would've thought of that.\" And then they're also\ngonna give me some pushback about like, \"Yeah, what you\nare asking them to do here, that's a bad idea. Let's do it this way.\" And I'm more than happy\nto have that happen. But it's just a lot of\nlike different interactions with different games or applications, the internet, just with\nthe computer in general. There's tons of bugs that end up popping up\nleft, right, center. So it's just me trying to\nuse it as much as possible and showing them what\nworks and what doesn't work and what I would like to be better. And then they take that feedback, and they usually create\namazing things for me. They solve these problems in\nways I would've never imagined. They're so good at everything they do. And so I'm just really thankful that I'm able to give them feedback and they can make something of it, 'cause a lot of my feedback\nis like really dumb. It's just like, \"I want this. Please do something about it.\" And we'll come back and\nsuper well thought out, and it's way better than anything I could have ever thought\nof or implemented myself. So they're just great. They're really, really cool. - As the BCI community grows,\nwould you like to hang out with the other folks with Neuralink? What relationship, if any,\nwould you wanna have with them? Because you said like they\nmight have a different set of like ideas of how to use the thing. - Yeah.\n- Would you be intimidated by their Webgrid performance? - No, no, I hope compete. I hope day one, they like\nwipe the floor with me. I hope they beat it and they crush it. Double it if they can. Just because, on one hand, it's only gonna push me to be better, 'cause I'm super competitive. I want other people to push me. I think that is important\nfor anyone trying to achieve greatness is they need\nother people around them who are going to push them to be better. And I even made a joke about it on X once. Like once the next people get chosen, like qubadi cot music, like\nI'm just excited to have other people to do this with and to like share experiences with. I'm more than happy to interact with them as much as they want, more than happy to give them advice. I don't know what kind of\nadvice I could give them, but if they have questions,\nI'm more than happy. - What advice would you have for the next participant\nin the clinical trial? - That they should have fun with this, because it is a lot of fun. And that I hope they\nwork really, really hard, because it's not just for us, it's for everyone that comes after us. And come to me if they need anything. And to go to Neuralink\nif they need anything. Man, Neuralink moves mountains. Like they do absolutely\nanything for me that they can. And it's an amazing\nsupport system to have. It puts my mind at ease\nfor like so many things that I have had like questions about, or so many things I wanna do. And they're always there, and\nthat's really, really nice. I would tell them not to be\nafraid to go to Neuralink with any questions that\nthey have, any concerns, anything that they're\nlooking to do with this. And any help that Neuralink\nis capable of providing, I know they will. And I don't know, I don't know. Just work your ass off,\nbecause it's really important that we try to give our all to this. - So have fun and work hard. - Yeah, yeah, there we go. Maybe that's what I'll just\nstart saying to people: have fun, work hard. - Now, you're a real pro athlete. Just keep it short.\n(Noland laughing) Maybe it's good to talk about\nwhat you've been able to do now that you have a Neuralink implant. Like the freedom you gain from this way of interacting\nwith the outside world. Like you play video games all night. And you do that by yourself. And that's a kind of freedom. Can you speak to that\nfreedom that you gain? - Yeah, it's what all, I don't know, people in my position want. They just want more independence. The more load that I can take away from people around me, the better. If I'm able to interact with the world without using my family, without going through any of my friends, like needing them to help\nme with things, the better. If I'm able to sit up\non my computer all night and not need someone to like sit me up, say like on my iPad, like in\na position where I can use it and then have to have them wait up for me all night until I'm ready\nto be done using it, it takes a load off of all of us. And it's really like all I can ask for. It's something that I could never thank Neuralink enough for. And I know my family feels the same way. Just being able to have the\nfreedom to do things on my own at any hour of the day or\nnight, it means the world to me. And I don't know. - When you're up at 2:00 AM\nplaying Webgrid by yourself, I just imagine like it's darkness and there's just a light glowing. And you're just focused. What's going through your mind? (Noland laughing) Or you were like in a state of flow where it's like the mind is empty, like those like Zen masters? - Yeah, generally, it is me\nplaying music of some sort. I have a massive playlist, and so I'm just like rocking out to music. And then it's also just\nlike a race against time, 'cause I'm constantly looking at how much battery percentage\nI have left on my implant. Like, all right, I have 30%, which equates to x amount of time, which means I have to break this record in the next hour and a half, or else, it's not happening tonight. And so it's a little\nstressful when that happens. When it's above 50%, I'm\nlike, \"Okay, like I got time.\" It starts getting down to 30 and then 20. It's like, all right, 10%, a little popup is gonna pop up right here, and it's gonna really\nscrew my Webgrid flow. It's gonna tell me that\nthere's like the low battery, low battery popup comes up, and I'm like, it's really gonna screw me over. So if I have to, if I'm\ngonna break this record, I have to do it in the\nnext like 30 seconds, or else, that popup is\ngonna get in the way, like cover my Webgrid. After that, I go click on\nit, go back into Webgrid. And I'm like, \"All\nright, that means I have 10 minutes left before this thing's dead.\" That's what's going on\nin my head generally, that and whatever song's playing. I want to break those records so bad. Like it's all I want\nwhen I'm playing Webgrid. It has become less of like, \"Oh, this is just a leisurely activity.\" Like I just enjoy doing this, because it just feels so\nnice and it puts me at ease. No, once I'm in Webgrid,\nyou better break this record or you're gonna waste like five hours of your life right now. And I don't know, it's just fun. It's fun, man. - Have you ever tried Webgrid with like two targets and three targets? Can you get higher BPS with that? - Can you do that? - [Bliss] You mean, like\ndifferent color targets, or you mean-\n- Oh, multiple targets, 'cause that change the thing. - Yeah, so BPS is a log\nof number of targets times correct minus\nincorrect divided by time. And so you can think of\nlike different clicks as basically doubling the\nnumber of active targets. - Got it.\n- So you know, you get basically higher BPS,\nthe more options there are, the more difficult to task. And there's also like zen\nmode you've played in before, which is like-\n- Yeah. Yeah, it covers the\nwhole screen with a grid. And I don't know. - [Lex] Yeah, and so you can go like, that's insane.\n- Yeah. - [Bliss] He doesn't like it\n'cause it didn't show BPS. - I had them put in a giant\nBPS in the background, so now it's like the opposite of Zen mode. It's like super hard mode,\nlike just metal mode. It's just like a giant\nnumber in the back counter. - [Bliss] We should rename that. Metal mode is a much better name now. - So you also play Civilization VI? - I love Civ VI, yeah. - [Lex] You usually go with Korea, you said?\n- I do, yeah. So the great part about\nKorea is they focus on like science tech victories,\nwhich was not planned. Like I've been playing Korea for years, and then all of the\nNeuralink stuff happened. So it kind of aligned. But what I've noticed with tech victories is if you can just rush\ntech, rush science, then you can do anything. Like at one point in the game, you'll be so far ahead of\neveryone technologically that you'll have like\nmusket men, infantry men, plane sometimes, and people\nwill still be fighting with like bows and arrows. And so if you want to\nwin a domination victory, you just get to a certain\npoint with the science and then go and wipe out\nthe rest of the world. Or you can just take science\nall the way and win that way, and you're gonna be so\nfar ahead of everyone 'cause you're producing so much science that it's not even close. I've accidentally won in different ways just by focusing on science. - Accidentally won by focusing on science. - I was playing only science, obviously. Like just science all the way, just tech. And I was trying to get like every tech in the tech tree and stuff. And then I accidentally won\nthrough a diplomatic victory, and I was so mad.\n(Lex laughing) I was so mad, 'cause it just like ends the game. One turn, it was like, \"Oh, you won, you're so diplomatic.\" I'm like, \"I don't wanna do this. I should have declared war\non more people or something.\" It was terrible, but you don't need like giant civilizations with\ntech, especially with Korea. You can keep it pretty small. So I generally just get\nto a certain military unit and put them all around my\nborder to keep everyone out, and then I will just build up. So very isolationist. - Nice.\n- Yeah. - Just work on the science and the tech. - [Noland] Yep, that's it. - You're making it sound so fun. - It's so much fun.\n- And I also saw Civilization VII trailer. - Oh man, I'm so pumped.\n- Yeah. And that's probably coming out- - Come on, Civ VII, hit me up. Alpha, beta tests, whatever. - Wait, when is it coming out? - 2025.\n- Yeah, yeah, next year, yeah. What other stuff would\nyou like to see improved about the Neuralink app and\njust the entire experience? - I would like to, like I said, get back to the like click on demand, like the regular clicks. That would be great. I would like to be able to\nconnect to more devices. Right now, it's just the computer. I'd like to be able to use it on my phone or use it on different\nconsoles, different platforms. I'd like to be able to control as much stuff as possible, honestly. Like an Optimus robot\nwould be pretty cool. That would be sick if I could\ncontrol an Optimus robot. The Link app itself, it\nseems like we are getting pretty dialed in to what it\nmight look like down the road. Seems like we've gotten through a lot of what I want from it at least. The only other thing I would say is like more control\nover all the parameters that I can tweak with my\nlike cursor and stuff. There's a lot of things that go into how the cursor moves in certain ways. And I have, I don't\nknow, like three or four of those parameters and there might- - Like gain and friction and all that? - Gain and friction, yeah. And there's maybe double\nthe amount of those with just like velocity and then with the actual dwell cursor. So I would like all of it. I want as much control over\nmy environment as possible, especially-\n- So you want like advanced mode? Like there's menus usually,\nthere's basic mode. And you're like one of those folks like- - I go the-\n- Power user advanced. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Got it. - That's what I want. I want as much control\nover this as possible. So yeah, that's really all I can ask for. Just give me everything. - Has speech been useful? Like just being able to talk also in addition to everything else? - Yeah, you mean like while I'm using it? - While you're using\nit, like speech to text? - Oh yeah.\n- Or do you type, or like, 'cause there's also a keyboard? That's really nice.\n- Yeah, yeah. So there's a virtual keyboard. That's another thing I\nwould like to work more on is finding some way to type\nor text in a different way. Right now, it is like\na dictation basically and a virtual keyboard that\nI can use with the cursor. But we've played around\nwith like finger spelling, like sign language, finger spelling. And that seems really promising. So I have this thought in my head that it's going to be a\nvery similar learning curve that I had with the cursor, where I went from attempted movement to imagined movement at one point. I have a feeling, this\nis just my intuition, that at some point, I'm going\nto be doing finger spelling and I won't need to actually attempt to finger spell anymore, that I'll just be able to think the like letter that I\nwant and it'll pop up. - That would be epic.\n- Yeah. - That's challenging, that's hard. That's a lot of work for\nyou to kinda take that leap. But that would be awesome. - And then like going from\nletters to words is another step. Like you would go from, right now, it's finger spelling of like just the sign language alphabet. But if it's able to pick that up, then it should be able to pick up like the whole sign\nlanguage like language. And so then if I could do\nsomething along those lines, or just the sign language spelled word, if I can spell it at a reasonable speed and it can pick that up, then I would just be able\nto think that through and it would do the same thing. I don't see why not. After what I saw with the cursor control, I don't see why it wouldn't work, but we'd have to play around with it more. - What was the process in\nterms of like training yourself to go from attempted movement\nto imagined movement? How long did that take? So how long would this\nkind of process take? - Well, it was a couple weeks before it just like happened upon me. But now that I know\nthat that was possible, I think I could make it\nhappen with other things. I think it would be much, much simpler. - Would you get an\nupgraded implant device? - Sure, absolutely. Whenever they'll let me. - So you don't have any concerns for you with the surgery experience? All of it was like no regrets? - No. - So everything's been good so far? - Yep. - You just keep getting upgrades. - Yeah, I mean, why not? I've seen how much it's\nimpacted my life already. And I know that everything\nfrom here on out, shit's gonna get better and better. So I would love to. I would love to get the upgrade. - What future capabilities\nare you excited about sort of beyond this kind of telepathy? Is vision interesting? So for folks who, for\nexample, who are blind, so you're like enabling\npeople to see, or for speech. - Yeah, there's a lot that's\nvery, very cool about this. I mean, we're talking about the brain, so like this is just motor cortex stuff. There's so much more that can be done. The vision one is fascinating to me. I think that is going\nto be very, very cool. To give someone the ability to see for the first time in their\nlife would just be, I mean it, it might be more amazing than\neven helping someone like me. Like that just sounds incredible. The speech thing is really interesting, being able to have some sort\nof like real time translation and cut away that language\nbarrier would be really cool. Any sort of like actual\nimpairments that it could solve, like with speech, would\nbe very, very cool. And then also, there are a\nlot of different disabilities that all originate in the brain. And you would be able to, hopefully be able to solve a lot of those. I know there's already stuff\nto help people with seizures that can be implanted in the brain. This would do, I imagine, the same thing. And so you could do something like that. I know that even someone like\nJoe Rogan has talked about the possibilities with being able to stimulate the brain in different ways. I'm not sure. I'm not sure how ethical\na lot of that would be. That's beyond me honestly. But I know that there's\na lot that can be done when we're talking about the brain and being able to go in and physically make changes to help people\nor to improve their lives. So I'm really looking forward to everything that comes from this. And I don't think it's all that far off. I think a lot of this can be\nimplemented within my lifetime, assuming that I live a long life. - What you were referring\nto is things like people suffering from depression or things of that nature\npotentially getting help. - Yeah, flip a switch like\nthat, make someone happy. I know, I think Joe has\ntalked about it more in terms of like you want to experience like what a drug trip feels like. Like you wanna experience\nwhat it'd be like to be on- - Of course.\n- Yeah, mushrooms or something like that, DMT. Like you can just flip\nthat switch in the brain. My buddy Bain has talked about\nbeing able to like wipe parts of your memory and\nre-experience things that, like for the first time, like your favorite movie\nor your favorite book. Like just wipe that out real quick, and then re-fall in love with\nHarry Potter or something. I told him, I was like, \"I don't know how I feel about like people being able to just\nwipe parts of your memory. That seems a little sketchy to me.\" He's like, \"They're already doing it.\" - Sounds legit. Yeah, I would love memory replay. Just like actually high\nresolution replay of old memories. - Yeah, I saw an episode of\n\"Black Mirror\" about that once. I don't think I want it. - Yeah, so \"Black Mirror\"\nalways kind of considers the worst case, which is important. I think people don't\nconsider the best case or the average case enough. I don't know what it is about us humans. We wanna think about the\nworst possible thing. We love drama. - [Noland] Yeah. (laughs) - It's like, how's this new\ntechnology gonna kill everybody? We just love that. Again like, yes, let's watch. - Hopefully, people don't think\nabout that too much with me. It'll ruin a lot of my plans. - Yeah, yeah. I assume you're gonna have\nto take over the world. I mean, I loved your Twitter. You tweeted, \"I'd like to make jokes about hearing voices in my head since getting the Neuralink, but I feel like people\nwould take it the wrong way. Plus, the voices in my\nhead told me not to.\" - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - Yeah.\n- Please never stop. So you're talking about Optimus. Is that something you would\nlove to be able to do, to control the robotic arm\nor the entirety of Optimus? - Oh yeah, for sure. For sure, absolutely. - You think there's something\nlike fundamentally different about just being able to\nphysically interact with the world? - Yeah, oh, 100%. I know another thing with like being able to like give people the\nability to like feel sensation and stuff too by going in with the brain and having the Neuralink maybe do that. That could be something that\ncould be translated through, transferred through the Optimus as well. Like there's all sorts of really cool interplay between that. And then also, like you said,\njust physically interacting. I mean, 99% of the things that I can't do myself obviously need, I need a caretaker for, someone to physically do things for me. If an Optimus robot could\ndo that, like I could live an incredibly independent life and not be such a burden\non those around me and it would change the\nway people like me live, at least until whatever\nthis is gets cured. But being able to interact\nwith the world physically, like that would just be amazing. And they're not just like for being, for having to be a caretaker or something, but something like I talked about, just being able to read a book. Imagine an Optimus robot just being able to hold a\nbook open in front of me, like get that smell again. I might not be able to\nfeel it at that point. Or maybe I could again with\nthe sensation and stuff. But there's something\ndifferent about reading like a physical book\nthan staring at a screen or listening to an audio book. I actually don't like audio books. I've listened to a ton\nof them at this point, but I don't really like 'em. I would much rather like\nread a physical copy. - So one of the things you would love to be able to experience\nis opening the book, bringing it up to you. And to feel the touch of the paper. - Yeah. Oh man, the touch, the smell. I mean, it's just like something about the words on the page, and they've replicated that page color on like the Kindle and stuff. Yeah, it's just not the same, yeah. So just something as simple as that. - So one of the things you miss is touch. - I do, yeah. - A lot of things that I\ninteract with in the world, like clothes or literally\nany physical thing that I interact with in\nthe world, a lot of times, what people around me will\ndo is they'll just come like, rub it on my face. They'll like lay something on\nme so I can feel the weight. They will rub a shirt on\nme so I can feel fabric. Like there's something\nvery profound about touch, and it's something that I miss a lot, and something I would love\nto do again, but we'll see. - What would be the first thing you do with a hand that can touch? Give your mom a hug after that, right? - Yeah, I know. It's one thing that I've asked like God for basically every day since my accident was just being able to like one day move, even if it was only like my hand. So that way, like I could\nsqueeze my mom's hand or something just to like show her that, like how much I care and how\nmuch I love her and everything. Something along those lines. Being able to just interact\nwith the people around me, handshake, give someone a hug. I don't know, anything like that. Being able to help me eat, like\nI'd probably get really fat, which would be a terrible, terrible thing. - Also beat Bliss in chess\non a physical chess board. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, there are just\nso many upsides. (laughs) And any way to find some way to feel like I'm bringing Bliss down to my level. - Yeah.\n- Because- - Yeah.\n- He's just such an amazing guy, and everything about him is just so above and beyond\nthat anything I can do to take him down a notch,\nI'm more than happy. - Yeah, humble him a bit, he needs it. - [Noland] Yeah. (laughs) - Okay. As he's sitting next to me. Did you ever make sense of why God puts good people through such hardship? - Oh, man. I think it's all about understanding how much we need God. And I don't think that there's\nany light without the dark. I think that if all of us\nwere happy all the time, there would be no reason\nto turn to God ever. I feel like there would be\nno concept of good or bad. And I think that as much\nof like the darkness and the evil that's in the\nworld, it makes us all appreciate the good and the things\nwe have so much more. And I think, like when I had my accident, one of the first things I said to one of my best friends was,\nand this was within like the first month or two\nafter my accident, I said, \"Everything about this\naccident has just made me understand and believe\nthat like God is real and that there really is a God, basically. And that like my interactions with him have all been real and worthwhile.\" And he said, if anything, seeing me go through this accident, he believes that there isn't a God. And it's a very different reaction. But I believe that it is\na way for God to test us, to build our character, to send us through trials and tribulations, to make sure that we\nunderstand how precious he is, and the things that he's given us and the time that he's given us. And then to hopefully\ngrow from all of that. I think that's a huge part of being here is to not just have an easy life and do everything that's easy, but to step out of our comfort zones and really challenge ourselves, because I think that's how we grow. - What gives you hope\nabout this whole thing we have going on, human civilization? - Oh, man. I think people are my biggest inspiration. Even just being at\nNeuralink for a few months, looking people in the eyes\nand hearing their motivations for why they're doing\nthis, it's so inspiring. And I know that they\ncould be other places, cushier jobs, working somewhere else, doing X, Y, or Z that doesn't\nreally mean that much. But instead they're here, and\nthey want to better humanity and they want a better,\njust the people around them, the people that they've\ninteracted with in their life, they wanna make better lives\nfor their own family members who might have disabilities,\nor they look at someone like me and they say, \"I can\ndo something about that so I'm going to.\" And it's always been what I've connected with most in the world are people. I've always been a people person and I love learning about people, and I love learning like\nhow people developed and where they came from. And to see like how much\npeople are willing to do for someone like me\nwhen they don't have to, and they're going out of their\nway to make my life better. It gives me a lot of hope\nfor just humanity in general, how much we care and how\nmuch we're capable of when we all kind of get together and try to make a difference. And I know there's a lot of\nbad out there in the world, but there always has been\nand there always will be. And I think that that is, it shows human resiliency and it shows what we're able to endure, and how much we just want to\nbe there and help each other, and how much satisfaction\nwe get from that, because I think that's one of the reasons that we're here is just\nto help each other. And I don't know, that\nalways gives me hope. It's just realizing that\nthere are people out there who still care and who wanna help. - And thank you for being\none such human being and continuing to be a great human being through everything you've been through and being an inspiration to many people, to myself, for many reasons,\nincluding your epic, unbelievably great performance on Webgrid. I'll be training all night\ntonight to try to catch up. - You can do it. - And I believe in you, that you can once you come back, so sorry to interrupt\nwith the Austin trip, once you come back, eventually beat Bliss. - Yeah, yeah, for sure. Absolutely.\n- I'm rooting for you. The whole world is rooting for you. - Thank you.\n- Thank you for everything you've done, man. - Thanks, thanks man. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Nolan Arbaugh, and\nbefore that, with Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew MacDougall,\nand Bliss Chapman.

    "transcript": "- The following is a conversation with Elon Musk, Part 2. The second time we spoke on the podcast, with parallels if not in\nquality then in outfit to the, objectively\nspeaking, greatest sequel of all time, \"Godfather Part II\". As many people know, Elon\nMusk is a leader of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. What may be less known is\nthat he's a world class engineer and designer,\nconstantly emphasizing first principles thinking in taking on big engineering problems\nthat many before him would consider impossible. As scientists and engineers, most of us don't question the way things are done. We simply follow the\nmomentum of the crowd. But revolutionary ideas\nthat change the world on the small and large scales happen when you return to the fundamentals and ask: \"Is there a better way?\" This conversation\nfocuses on the incredible engineering and innovation done in brain computer interfaces at Neuralink. This work promises to help\ntreat neuro biological diseases to help us further\nunderstand the connection between the individual neuron, to the high level function\nof the human brain and finally, to one day expand\nthe capacity of the brain, through two-way communication\nwith computational devices, the internet and artificial\nintelligence systems. This is the \"Artificial\nIntelligence Podcast\". If you enjoy it, subscribe\nby YouTube, Apple Podcast, Spotify, support on Patreon\nor simply connect with me on Twitter @Lexfridman,\nspelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N. And now, as an anonymous YouTube commenter referred to our previous\nconversation as the quote, \"Historical first video of two robots \"conversing without supervision\" here's the second time,\nthe second conversation with Elon Musk. Let's start with an easy\nquestion about consciousness. In your view, is consciousness something that's unique to humans,\nor is it something that permeates all matter, almost like a fundamental force of physics? - I don't think consciousness\npermeates all matter. - Panpsychists believe that,\nthere's a philosophical-- - How would you tell? (both laugh) - That's true, that's a good point. - I believe in scientific method, don't wanna blow your mind or anything but the scientific method is like if you cannot test the hypothesis then you cannot reach meaningful\nconclusion that it is true. - Do you think consciousness,\nunderstanding consciousness, is within the reach of science\nor the scientific method? - We can dramatically\nimprove our understanding of consciousness. I would be hard pressed\nto say that we understand anything with complete accuracy but can we dramatically improve our understanding of consciousness? I believe the answer is yes. - Does an A.I. system in your view have to have consciousness in order to achieve human level or\nsuperhuman level intelligence? Does it need to have some\nof these human qualities like consciousness, maybe\na body, maybe a fear of mortality, capacity\nto love, those kinds of silly human things? - There's the scientific method\nwhich I very much believe in where something is true to the degree that it is testably so and otherwise you're really just\ntalking about preferences or untestable beliefs\nor that kind of thing. So ends up being somewhat\nof a semantic question where we're conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence. If we parse them out and say, are we headed towards the future where an A.I. will be able\nto outthink us in every way, then the answer is unequivocally yes. - In order for an A.I. system that needs to outthink us in every\nway, it also needs to have a capacity to have\nconsciousness, self-awareness and understand-- - It will be self-aware, yes. That's different from consciousness. I mean to me, what\nconsciousness feels like, it feels like consciousness\nis in a different dimension but this could be just an illusion. If you damage your brain\nin some way, physically you damage your consciousness, which implies that consciousness is a physical phenomenon, in my view. The things that I think\nare really quite likely is that digital intelligence will be able to outthink us in every\nway and it will soon be able to simulate what\nwe consider consciousness so to a degree that you would not be able to tell the difference. - And from the aspect of\nthe scientific method, it might as well be consciousness, if we can simulate it perfectly? - If you can't tell the difference, it's sort of the Turing test but think of it more of sort of an advanced version of the Turing test. If you're talking to a\ndigital super intelligence and can't tel if that is\na computer or a human, like let's say you're\njust having a conversation over a phone or a video\nconference or something aware, looks like a person, makes\nall of the right inflections and movements and all the small subtleties that constitute a human and talks like a human,\nmakes mistakes like a human and you literally just can't tell is this, are you video conferencing\nwith a person or an A.I.? - Might as well be human,\nso on a darker topic, you've expressed serious concern about existential threats of A.I. It's perhaps one of\nthe greatest challenges that our civilization faces\nbut since, I would say, we're kind of an optimistic\ndescendants of apes, perhaps we can find\nseveral paths of escaping the harm of A.I., so if I can give you three options, maybe you can comment which do you think is the most promising? So one is scaling up\nefforts on A.I. safety and beneficial A.I.\nresearch, in hope of finding an algorithmic or maybe a policy solution. Two is becoming a multi-planetary species as quickly as possible and\nthree is merging with A.I. and riding the wave of that\nincreasing intelligence, as it continuously improves. What do you think is the most\npromising, most interesting. As a civilization that\nwe should invest in? - I think there's a tremendous amount of investment going on in A.I. Where there's a lack of investment is in A.I. safety and there should be in my view, a government agency that oversees anything related to A.I. to confirm that it does not represent a public safety risk, just\nas there is regulatory authority for the Food\nand Drug Administration, that's there for automotive safety, there's the FAA for aircraft safety. We're generally coming to the conclusion that it is important to\nhave a government referee or a referee that is\nserving the public interest in ensuring that things are safe when there's a potential\ndanger to the public. I would argue that A.I. is unequivocally something that has\npotential to be dangerous to the public and therefore should have a regulatory agency, just as other things that are dangerous to the\npublic have a regulatory agency. But let me tell you, the problem with this is that government moves very slowly. Usually the way a regulatory\nagency comes into being is that something terrible happens, there's a huge public\noutcry and year after that, there's a regulatory agency\nor a rule put in place. Take something like seatbelts. It was known for, I don't\nknow, a decade or more? That seatbelts would have a massive impact on safety and save so many\nlives and serious injuries and the car industry\nfought the requirement to put seatbelts in tooth and nail. That's crazy and I don't know, hundreds of thousands\nof people probably died because of that and they said people wouldn't buy cars\nif they had seatbelts, which is obviously absurd. Or look at the tobacco industry and how long they fought\nanything about smoking. That's part of why I help make that movie, \"Thank You for Smoking\", because you'll see just how pernicious it can be when you have these companies effectively achieve regulatory capture of government, they're bad. People in the A.I. community refer to the advent of digital\nsuper intelligence as the singularity. That is not to say that it is good or bad but that it is very difficult to predict what will happen after that point and that there's some probability it will be bad, some\nprobability it will be good. We obviously want to\naffect that probability and have it be more good than bad. - Well let me, on the merger with A.I., question an incredible work\nthat's being done at Neuralink. There's a lot of\nfascinating innovation here, across different disciplines going on. So the flexible wires,\nthe robotic sewing machine that responds to brain movement and everything around\nensuring safety and so on. So we currently understand very little about the human brain. Do you also hope that\nthe work at Neuralink will help us understand more about the human mind, about the brain? - Yeah, I think the work at Neuralink will definitely shed a lot of insight into how the\nbrain, the mind works. Right now, just the data we have regarding how the brain works is very limited. We've got FMRI, that's\nkind of like putting a stethoscope on the\noutside of a factory wall and then putting it all\nover the factory wall and you can sort of hear the sounds but you don't know what the\nmachines are doing really. You can infer a few things but it's a very broad brushstroke. In order to really know\nwhat's going on in the brain, you have to have high precision sensors and the you wanna have\nstimulus and response like if you trigger a\nneuron, how do you feel, what do you see, how does it change your perception of the world? - You're speaking to physically, just getting close to the\nbrain, being able to measure signals from the brain, will give us, open a door inside the factory? - Yes, exactly, being able to have high precision sensors that tell you what individual neurons are doing and then being able to trigger a neuron and see what the response is in the brain. So you can see the consequences\nof, if you fire this neuron, what happens, how do you\nfeel, what does it change? It'll be really profound\nto have this in people because people can\narticulate their change. Like if there's a change in mood, or if they've can tell\nyou if they can see better or hear better or be\nable to form sentences better or worse or their\nmemories are jogged or that kind of thing. - So on the human side,\nthere's this incredible, general malleability,\nplasticity of the human brain. The human brain adapts, adjusts and so on. - [Elon] It's not that\nplastic, to be totally frank. - So there's a firm\nstructure but nevertheless there is some plasticity\nand the open question is if I could ask a broad question, is how much of that\nplasticity can be utilized? On the human side, there's some plasticity in the human brain\nand on the machine side, we have neural networks, machine learning, artificial intelligence,\nit's able to adjust and figure out signals so\nthere's a mysterious language that we don't perfectly\nunderstand that's within the human brain and then\nwe're trying to understand that language to\ncommunicate both directions. So the brain is adjusting, a little bit, we don't know how much and the machine is adjusting, where do you see, as they try to sort of reach together, almost like with an alien\nspecies, try to find a protocol, a communication protocol that works. Where do you see the\nbiggest benefit arriving, from on the machine\nside, or the human side? Do you see both of them working together? - I should think the machine\nside is far more malleable than the biological\nside, by a huge amount. It'll be the machine\nthat adapts to the brain. That's the only thing that's possible, the brain can't adapt\nthat well to the machine. You can't have neurons start to regard an electrode as another neuron, because neurons is like the pulse and so something else is pulsing, so there is that elasticity\nin the interface, which we believe is\nsomething that can happen but the vast majority of malleability will have to be on the machine side. - But it's interesting, when you look at the synaptic plasticity,\nat the interface side, there might be like an\nemergent plasticity, 'cause it's a whole nother,\nit's not like in the brain, it's a whole nother\nextension of the brain. We might have to redefine what it means to be malleable for the brain. So maybe the brain is able to\nadjust to external interfaces. - There'll be some adjustment to the brain because there's gonna be something reading and simulating the brain and\nso it will adjust to that thing but the vast majority of the adjustment will be on the machine side. It just has to be that\notherwise it will not work. Ultimately, we currently\noperate on two layers. We have sort of a limbic\nprime furtive brain layer which is where all of our\nimpulses are coming from. It's sort of like we've got, we've got like a monkey brain with\na computer stuck on it. That's the human brain\nand a lot of our impulses and everything are driven\nby the monkey brain and the computer, the cortex is constantly trying to make the monkey brain happy. It's not the cortex that's\nsteering the monkey brain, it's the monkey brain steering the cortex. - Like the cortex is the\npart that tells the story of the whole thing, so\nwe convince ourselves it's more interesting than\njust the monkey brain. - The cortex is what we\ncall human intelligence. That's like the advanced computer, relative to other creatures. The other creatures do not have, really they don't have\nthe computer, or they have a very weak computer, relative to humans. It sort of seems like,\nsurely the really smart thing should control the dumb thing? But actually, the dumb thing\ncontrols the smart thing. - So do you think some of the same kind of machine learning\nmethods, whether that's natural language processing applications are going to be applied\nfor the communication between the machine and the brain? To learn how to do certain\nthings like movement of the body, how to process\nvisual stimuli and so on? Do you see the value of\nusing machine learning to understand the language of the two-way communication with the brain? - Yeah, sure, absolutely. I mean, we're a neural net and the A.I.'s basically a neural net. So it's like digital\nneural net will interface with biological neural net and hopefully bring us along for the ride, you know? But the vast majority of our\nintelligence will be digital. So think of like the\ndifference in intelligence between your cortex and your\nlimbic system is gigantic. Your limbic system really\nhas no comprehension of what the hell the cortex is doing. It's just literally\nhungry or tired or angry or sexy or something, you know? And that communicates\nthat impulse to the cortex and tells the cortex to go satisfy that. A massive amount of thinking,\nlike truly stupendous amount of thinking has gone into sex. Without purpose, without procreation which is actually quite a silly action in the absence of procreation. It's a bit silly, so why are you doing it? Because to make the limbic\nsystem happy, that's why. But it's pretty absurd really. - Well the whole of\nexistence is pretty absurd in some kind of sense. - Yeah but this is a lot of computation has gone into how can I do more of that? With procreation not even being a factor? This is, I think, a very important area of research by NSFW. - An agency that should\nreceive a lot of funding, especially after this conversation. - I propose the formation\nof a new agency (laughs). - Oh boy, what is the most exciting, or some of the most\nexciting things that you see in the future impact of Neuralink? Both on the science and engineering and societal broad impact? - So Neuralink, I think\nat first, will solve a lot of brain-related diseases. So could be anything from\nlike autism, schizophrenia, memory loss, like everyone\nexperiences memory loss at certain points in age. Parents can't remember their kid's names and that kind of thing,\nso there's, I think, a tremendous amount of\ngood that Neuralink can do in solving critical damage\nto brain or the spinal cord. There's a lot can be done\nto improve quality of life of individuals and those\nwill steps along the way and then ultimately,\nit's intended to address the existential risk associated with digital super intelligence. We will not be able to be smarter than a digital super\ncomputer, so therefore if you cannot beat 'em, join 'em and at least we will have that option. - You have hope that\nNeuralink will be able to be a kind of connection to allow us to merge, to ride the wave of\nthe improving A.I. systems? - I think the chance is above 0%. - So it's not on zero, there's a chance. - Have you seen \"Dumb and Dumber\"? - Yes (laughs) - [Elon] So I'm saying there's a chance. - You're saying one in a\nbillion or one in a million, whatever it was on \"Dumb and Dumber\". - You know, it went from\nmaybe one in a million to improving, maybe it'll\nbe one in a thousand and then one in a hundred\nand then one in 10. Depends on the rate of\nimprovement of Neuralink and how fast we're able to make progress. - Well I've talked to a few folks here that are quite brilliant\nengineers, I'm excited. - I think it's fundamentally\ngood, giving somebody back full motor control after they've\nhad a spinal cord injury. Restoring brain\nfunctionality after a stroke. Solving debilitating genetically\noriented brain diseases. These are all incredibly great I think and in order to do these,\nyou have to be able to interface with the\nneurons at a detail level and you need to be able\nto fire the right neurons, read the right neurons\nand then effectively you can create a circuit,\nreplace what's broken with silicon and\nessentially, they'll end up with the same functionality\nand then over time, we develop a tertiary\nlayer, so limbic system as the primary layer, then the cortex is like a second layer and as said, the cortex is vastly more\nintelligent than the limbic system but people generally like the fact that they have a limbic\nsystem and a cortex. I haven't met anyone who wants to delete either one of them. They're like okay, I'll\nkeep them both, that's cool. - The limbic system's kinda fun. - Yeah, that's where\nthe fun is, absolutely and then people generally don't wanna lose their cortex either. Right, so they like having the\ncortex and the limbic system and then there's a tertiary layer which will be digital super intelligence and I think there's room for optimism, given that the cortex is very intelligent and the limbic system is\nnot, they work together well. Perhaps there can be a tertiary layer where digital super intelligence lies and that will be vastly more\nintelligent than the cortex but still co-exist\npeacefully and in a benign manner with the cortex and limbic system. - That's a super exciting future, both on the low level engineering that I saw is being done here and an actual possibility\nin the next few decades. - It's important that\nNeuralink solve this problem sooner rather than\nlater, because the point at which we have digital\nsuper intelligence, that's when we pass the singularity and things become just very uncertain. Doesn't mean that they're\nnecessarily bad or good but the point at which\nwe pass the singularity, things become extremely unstable. So we want to have a human brain interface before the singularity, or\nat least not long after it to minimize existential risk for humanity and consciousness as we know it. - But there's a lot of fascinating, actual engineering of low level problems here at Neuralink that are quite exciting. What-- - The problems we face at\nNeuralink are material science, electrical engineering, software, mechanical engineering, micro fabrication. It's a bunch of engineering\ndisciplines, essentially. That's what it comes down\nto, is you have to have a tiny electrode so it\ndoesn't hurt neurons but it's gotta last for\nas long as a person. So it's gotta last for decades and then you gotta take that signal and you got to process that signal locally at low power, so we need a\nlot of chip design engineers, because we gotta do signal processing and do so in a very power-efficient way. So that we don't heat your brain up, because the brain's very heat-sensitive. And then we gotta take those signals and we gotta do something with them and then we gotta stimulate the back so you could bidirectional communication. So somebody who's good\nat material science, software, mechanical engineering,\nelectrical engineering, chip design, micro fabrication, those are the things we need to work on. We need to be good at material science so that we can have tiny electrodes that last a long time\nand it's the tough thing, the material science\nproblem is a tough one because you're trying\nto read and stimulate electrically in an\nelectrically active area. Your brain is very electrically active, electrochemically active,\nso how do you have say a coating on the electrode that doesn't dissolve over\ntime and is safe in the brain? This is a very hard problem. And then how do you collect those signals in a way that is the most efficient? Because you really just\nhave very tiny amounts of power to process those signals and then we need to automate the whole thing, so it's LASIK. If this is done by neurosurgeons, there's no way it can scale\nto large numbers of people. And it needs to scale to\nlarge numbers of people because I think ultimately\nwe want the future to be determined by a\nlarge number of humans. - Do you think this has a chance to revolutionize surgery, period? So the neurosurgery and\nsurgery all across-- - Yeah, for sure, it's\ngotta be like LASIK. If LASIK had to be hand\ndone, done by hand, by a person, that wouldn't be great. It's done by a robot\nand the ophthalmologist kinda just needs to make sure you're you. Your head's in the right position and then they just press a button and go. - So Smart Summon and\nsoon auto park takes on the full, beautiful mess of parking lots and their human-to-human\nnonverbal communication, I think it has actually the potential to have a profound impact in changing how are civilization\nlooks at A.I. and robotics because this is the\nfirst time human beings, people that don't own a Tesla, may have never seen a Tesla\nor heard about a Tesla, get to watch hundreds of thousands of cars without a driver. Do you see it this way? Almost like an education tool\nfor the world about A.I.? Do you feel the burden of\nthat, the excitement of that, or do you just think it's\na smart parking feature? - I do think you are getting\nat something important which is, most people have\nnever really seen a robot. And what is the car, that is autonomous, it's a four wheel drive robot. - It communicates a certain\nmessage with everything from safety to the possibility\nof what A.I. could bring, to its current limitations,\nits current challenges, it's what's possible. Do you feel the burden\nof that, almost like a communicator, educator\nto the world about A.I.? - We're just really trying to make people's lives easier with autonomy but now that you mention\nit, I think it will be an eye-opener to people about robotics because they've really never seen, most people have never see a robot and there are hundreds\nof thousands of Teslas. It won't be long before\nthere's a million of them that have autonomous capability and they drive without a person in it and you can see the evolution\nof the car's personality and thinking with each\niteration of autopilot. You can see it's uncertain about this, now it's more certain, now it's moving in a slightly different way. I can tell immediately if\na car is on Tesla autopilot because it's got these\nlittle nuances of movement. It just moves in a slightly different way. Cars on Tesla autopilot,\nfor example, on the highway are far more precise about being in the center of the lane than a person. If you drive down the highway and look at where cars are, the human driven cars are within their lane. They're like bumper cars, they're\nmoving all over the place. Car on autopilot, dead center. - Yeah, so the incredible work that's going into that neural network, it's learning fast, autonomy's still very, very hard, we don't actually know how hard it is fully, of course. But you look at most problems you tackle, this one included with an exponential lens but even with an exponential improvement, things can take longer\nthan expected, sometimes. So where does Tesla currently stand on its quest for full autonomy? What's your sense, when can we see successful deployment of full autonomy? - Well on the highway\nalready, the probability of intervention is extremely low. So for highway autonomy, with\nthe latest release especially, the probability of needing to\nintervene is really quite low. In fact I'd say for stop and go traffic, it's far safer than a person right now. And so the probability of an injury or an impact is much, much lower for autopilot than a person. And then with navigating autopilot, it can change lanes,\ntake highway interchanges and then we're coming at\nit from the other direction which is low speed, full autonomy. In a way this is like how\ndoes a person learn to drive? You learn to drive in the parking lot. First time your learned to drive, probably wasn't jumping on Market Street in San Francisco, that would be crazy. You learn to drive in the parking lot, get things right at low speed and then the missing piece\nthat we're working on is traffic lights and stop streets. Stop streets, I would\nsay actually are also relatively easy because you kind of know where the stop street is, worse case you can geo-code it and\nthen use visualization to see what the line\nis and stop at the line to eliminate the GPS error. So actually, I'd say it's probably complex traffic lights and very windy roads are the two of things\nthat need to get solved. - What's harder, perception\nor control for these problems? So being able to perfectly\nperceive everything? Or figuring out a plan, once\nyou perceive everything, how to interact with all the\nagents in the environment? In your sense, from a\nlearning perspective, is perception or action harder in that giant, beautiful, multi-task learning neural network? - The hardest thing is having\naccurate representation of the physical objects in vector space. So taking the visual input,\nprimarily visual input, some sonar and radar and then creating an accurate vector space representation of the objects around you. Once you have an accurate\nvector space representation, the plank and control\nis relatively easier. It is relatively easy. Basically, once you have accurate vector space representation, you're kinda like a video game, like\ncars in Grand Theft Auto or something, like they work pretty well. They drive down the\nroad, they don't crash, pretty much, unless you crash into them. That's because they've got an accurate vector space representation\nof where the cars are and then they're rendering\nthat as the output. - Do you have a sense, high level, that Tesla's on track on being able to achieve full autonomy? - Yeah, absolutely. - And still no driver\nstate, driver sensing. - We have driver sensing\nwith torque on the wheel. - That's right, by the way,\njust a quick comment on karaoke. Most people think it's\nfun but I also think it's a driving feature I've\nbeen saying for a long time, singing in a car's really\ngood for attention management and vigilance management. - That's right, Tesla karaoke is great. It's one of the most\nfun features of the car. - Do you think you'll connect between fun and safety sometimes? - Yeah, you can do both at\nthe same time, that's great. - I just met with Andrew\nand wife of Carl Sagan, who direct \"Cosmos\". - I'm genuinely a big fan of Carl Sagan, he was super cool and had a\ngreat way of putting things. All the clashes of all civilization, everything we've ever known and done is on this tiny blue dot. You also get too trapped in there, there's like squabbles amongst humans and there's nobody thinking\nof the big picture. They take civilization and\nour continued existence for granted, they shouldn't do that. Look at the history of civilizations. They rise and they fall and now, civilization is globalized\nand so we're a civilization, I think now, it rises and falls together, there's not geographic isolation. This is a big risk,\nthings don't always go up. That should be, that's an\nimportant lesson of history. - In 1990 at the request of Carl Sagan, the Voyager 1 spacecraft\nwhich is a spacecraft that's reaching out farther\nthan anything human made into space, turned around\nto take a picture of earth from 3.7 billion miles\naway and as you're talking about the pale, blue dot, that picture, the earth takes up less than\na single pixel in that image. Appearing as a tiny blue dot, as a \"pale, blue dot\"\nas Carl Sagan called it. So he spoke about this dot of ours in 1994 and if you could humor me, I was wondering if in the last two minutes, you could read the words that he wrote\ndescribing this pale blue dot. - Sure, it's funny, the universe appears to be 13.8 billion years old. Earth is like four and\nhalf billion years old. You know, in another\nhalf billion years or so, the sun will expand and probably evaporate the oceans and make\nlife impossible on earth. Which means that if it had\ntaken consciousness 10% longer to evolve, it would never\nhave evolved at all. Just 10% longer. And I wonder, I wonder how many dead one planet civilizations there\nare, out there in the cosmos. That never made it to the other planet and ultimately extinguish themselves or destroyed by external factors. Probably a few, it's only just possible to travel to Mars, just barely. If G was 10% more, wouldn't work really. If G was 10% lower, it would be easy. We can go single stage\nfrom the surface of Mars, all ways over to the Earth. Because Mars is 37% of the\nEarth's gravity, thereabouts. We need a giant boost to get off Earth. Channeling Carl Sagan,\n\"Look again at that dot. \"That's here, that's home, that's us. \"On it, everyone you\nlove, everyone you know, \"everyone you've ever heard of, \"every human being who ever was \"lived out their lives. \"the aggregate of our joy and suffering, \"thousands of confident religions, \"ideologies and economic doctrines, \"every hunter and forager, every hero \"and coward, every creator\nand destroyer of civilization, \"every king and peasant,\nevery young couple in love, \"every mother and father, hopeful child, \"inventor and explorer,\nevery teacher of morals, \"every corrupt politician,\nevery 'superstar', \"every 'supreme' leader, every saint \"and sinner in the history\nof our species lived there \"on a mote of dust,\nsuspended in a sunbeam. \"Our planet is a lonely speck in the great \"enveloping cosmic dark. \"In our obscurity, in all this vastness, \"there is no hint that help\nwill come from elsewhere \"to save us from ourselves. \"the Earth is the only world known \"so far to harbor life,\nthere is nowhere else. \"At least in the near future, \"to which our species could migrate.\" This is not true (laughs). This is possible, Mars. - And I think Carl Sagan\nwould agree with that. He couldn't even imagine it at that time. So thank you for making the world dream and thank you for talking\ntoday, I really appreciate it, thank you. - [Elon] Thank you.",

    "transcript": "- The following is a\nconversation with Elon Musk. He's the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and a co-founder of\nseveral other companies. This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. This series includes leading researchers in academia and industry, including CEOs and CTOs of automotive, robotics, AI and technology companies. This conversation\nhappened after the release of the paper from our group at MIT on driver functional vigilance during use of Tesla's Autopilot. The Tesla team reached out to me offering a podcast\nconversation with Mr. Musk. I accepted with full control\nof questions I could ask and the choice of what\nis released publicly. I ended up editing out\nnothing of substance. I've never spoken with Elon\nbefore this conversation, publicly or privately. Neither he nor his\ncompanies have any influence on my opinion, nor on\nthe rigor and integrity of the scientific method that I practice in my position at MIT. Tesla has never financially\nsupported my research and I've never owned a Tesla vehicle, and I've never owned Tesla stock. This podcast is not a scientific paper, it is a conversation. I respect Elon as I do all other leaders and engineers I've spoken with. We agree on some things\nand disagree on others. My goal, as always with\nthese conversations, is to understand the way\nthe guest sees the world. One particular point of\ndisagreement in this conversation was the extent to which\ncamera-based driver monitoring will improve outcomes and for how long it will remain relevant\nfor AI-assisted driving. As someone who works\non and is fascinated by human-centered artificial intelligence, I believe that, if implemented\nand integrated effectively, camera-based driver monitoring\nis likely to be of benefit in both the short term and the long term. In contrast, Elon and Tesla's focus is on the improvement of Autopilot such that its statistical safety benefits override any concern for\nhuman behavior and psychology. Elon and I may not agree on everything, but I deeply respect the\nengineering and innovation behind the efforts that he leads. My goal here is to catalyze a rigorous, nuanced and objective discussion in industry and academia\non AI-assisted driving, one that ultimately makes\nfor a safer and better world. And now, here's my\nconversation with Elon Musk. What was the vision, the dream, of Autopilot in the beginning? The big picture system level\nwhen it was first conceived and started being installed in 2014, the hardware in the cars? What was the vision, the dream? - I wouldn't characterize\nit as a vision or dream, it's simply that there are\nobviously two massive revolutions in the automobile industry. One is the transition to electrification, and then the other is autonomy. And it became obvious to\nme that, in the future, any car that does not have autonomy would be about as useful as a horse. Which is not to say that there's no use, it's just rare, and\nsomewhat idiosyncratic, if somebody has a horse at this point. It's just obvious that cars will drive themselves completely, it's just a question of time. And if we did not participate\nin the autonomy revolution, then our cars would not\nbe useful to people, relative to cars that are autonomous. I mean, an autonomous\ncar is arguably worth five to 10 times more than a\ncar which is not autonomous. - In the long term. - Depends what you mean by long term but, let's say at least for\nthe next five years, perhaps 10 years. - So there are a lot of very\ninteresting design choices with Autopilot early on. First is showing on\nthe instrument cluster, or in the Model 3 and\nthe center stack display, what the combined sensor suite sees. What was the thinking behind that choice? Was there a debate, what was the process? - The whole point of the display is to provide a health check on the vehicle's perception of reality. So the vehicle's taking in information from a bunch of sensors,\nprimarily cameras, but also radar and\nultrasonics, GPS and so forth. And then, that information\nis then rendered into vector space with a bunch of objects, with properties like lane lines and traffic lights and other cars. And then, in vector\nspace, that is re-rendered onto a display so you can confirm whether the car knows what's going on or not, by looking out the window. - Right, I think that's an\nextremely powerful thing for people to get an understanding, sort of become one with the system and understanding what\nthe system is capable of. Now, have you considered showing more? So if we look at the computer vision, like road segmentation, lane detection, vehicle detection, object\ndetection, underlying the system, there is at the edges, some uncertainty. Have you considered revealing the parts that the uncertainty in\nthe system, the sort of-- - Probabilities associated with say, image recognition or something like that? - Yeah, so right now, it shows\nthe vehicles in the vicinity, a very clean crisp image,\nand people do confirm that there's a car in front of me and the system sees there's\na car in front of me, but to help people build an intuition of what computer vision is, by showing some of the uncertainty. - Well, in my car I always look\nat this with the debug view. And there's two debug views. One is augmented vision,\nwhich I'm sure you've seen, where it's basically we\ndraw boxes and labels around objects that are recognized. And then there's we what\ncall the visualizer, which is basically vector\nspace representation, summing up the input from all sensors. That does not show any pictures, which basically shows the car's view of the world in vector space. But I think this is very difficult for normal people to understand, they're would not know what\nthing they're looking at. - So it's almost an HMI challenge through the current things that are\nbeing displayed is optimized for the general public understanding of what the system's capable of. - If you have no idea how\ncomputer vision works or anything, you can still look at the screen and see if the car knows what's going on. And then if you're a development engineer, or if you have the\ndevelopment build like I do, then you can see all\nthe debug information. But this would just be like\ntotal gibberish to most people. - What's your view on how\nto best distribute effort? So there's three, I would\nsay, technical aspects of Autopilot that are really important. So it's the underlying algorithms, like the neural network architecture, there's the data that it's trained on, and then there's the hardware\ndevelopment and maybe others. So, look, algorithm, data, hardware. You only have so much money,\nonly have so much time. What do you think is\nthe most important thing to allocate resources to? Or do you see it as\npretty evenly distributed between those three? - We automatically get\nvast amounts of data because all of our cars have eight external facing cameras, and radar, and usually\n12 ultrasonic sensors, GPS obviously, and IMU. And we've got about\n400,000 cars on the road that have that level of data. Actually, I think you keep quite\nclose track of it actually. - Yes. - Yeah, so we're approaching\nhalf a million cars on the road that have the full sensor suite. I'm not sure how many\nother cars on the road have this sensor suite, but I'd be surprised if\nit's more than 5,000, which means that we have\n99% of all the data. - So there's this huge inflow of data. - Absolutely, a massive inflow of data. And then it's taken us about three years, but now we've finally developed our full self-driving computer, which can process an\norder of magnitude as much as the NVIDIA system that we\ncurrently have in the cars, and to use it, you unplug\nthe NVIDIA computer and plug the Tesla\ncomputer in and that's it. In fact, we still are exploring the boundaries of its capabilities. We're able to run the\ncameras at full frame-rate, full resolution, not even crop the images, and it's still got headroom\neven on one of the systems. The full self-driving computer\nis really two computers, two systems on a chip,\nthat are fully redundant. So you could put a boat through basically any part of that\nsystem and it still works. - The redundancy, are they\nperfect copies of each other or-- - Yeah. - Oh, so it's purely for redundancy as opposed to an arguing\nmachine kind of architecture where they're both making decisions, this is purely for redundancy. - Think of it more like it's a twin-engine commercial aircraft. The system will operate best\nif both systems are operating, but it's capable of\noperating safely on one. So, as it is right now, we can just run, we haven't even hit\nthe edge of performance so there's no need to actually distribute functionality across both SOCs. We can actually just run a\nfull duplicate on each one. - So you haven't really explored or hit the limit of the system. - [Elon] No not yet, the limit, no. - So the magic of deep learning is that it gets better with data. You said there's a huge inflow of data, but the thing about driving,\n- Yeah. - the really valuable data to\nlearn from is the edge cases. I've heard you talk somewhere\nabout Autopilot disengagements being an important moment of time to use. Is there other edge cases or perhaps can you speak\nto those edge cases, what aspects of them might be valuable, or if you have other ideas, how to discover more and more and more edge cases in driving? - Well there's a lot of\nthings that are learnt. There are certainly edge cases where, say somebody's on Autopilot\nand they take over, and then that's a trigger\nthat goes out to our system and says, okay, did they\ntake over for convenience, or did they take over\nbecause the Autopilot wasn't working properly? There's also, let's say\nwe're trying to figure out, what is the optimal spline for\ntraversing an intersection. Then the ones where there\nare no interventions are the right ones. So you then you say, okay,\nwhen it looks like this, do the following. And then you get the optimal spline for navigating a complex intersection. - So there's kind of the common case, So you're trying to capture\na huge amount of samples of a particular intersection\nwhen things went right, and then there's the edge case where, as you said, not for convenience, but something didn't go exactly right. - So if somebody started\nmanual control from Autopilot. And really, the way to look at this is view all input as error. If the user had to do\ninput, there's something, all input is error. - That's a powerful line\nto think of it that way 'cause it may very well be error, but if you wanna exit the highway, or if it's a navigation decision that Autopilot's not\ncurrently designed to do, then the driver takes\nover, how do you know the difference?\n- Yeah, that's gonna change with Navigate on Autopilot,\nwhich we've just released, and without stalk confirm. Assuming control in order\nto do a lane change, or exit a freeway, or doing\na highway interchange, the vast majority of that will go away with the release that just went out. - Yeah, so that, I don't\nthink people quite understand how big of a step that is. - Yeah, they don't. If you drive the car then you do. - So you still have to keep your hands on the steering wheel currently when it does the automatic lane change. There's these big leaps through\nhe development of Autopilot, through its history and, what stands out to you as the big leaps? I would say this one,\nNavigate on Autopilot without having to confirm is a huge leap. - It is a huge leap.\n- What are the-- It also automatically overtakes slow cars. So it's both navigation and\nseeking the fastest lane. So it'll overtake slow\ncars and exit the freeway and take highway interchanges, and then we have traffic\nlight recognition, which introduced initially as a warning. I mean, on the development\nversion that I'm driving, the car fully stops and\ngoes at traffic lights. - So those are the steps, right? You've just mentioned some things that are an inkling of a\nstep towards full autonomy. What would you say are\nthe biggest technological roadblocks to full self-driving? - Actually, the full self-driving\ncomputer that we just, the Tesla, what we call, FSD computer that's now in production, so if you order any Model S or X, or any Model 3 that has the\nfull self-driving package, you'll get the FSD computer. That's important to have\nenough base computation. Then refining the neural net\nand the control software. All of that can just be provided\nas an over-the-air update. The thing that's really profound, and what I'll be emphasizing\nat the investor day that we're having focused on autonomy, is that the car is\ncurrently being produced, with the hard word\ncurrently being produced, is capable of full self-driving. - But capable is an\ninteresting word because-- - [Elon] The hardware is. - Yeah, the hardware. - And as we refine the software, the capabilities will\nincrease dramatically, and then the reliability\nwill increase dramatically, and then it will receive\nregulatory approval. So essentially, buying a car today is an investment in the future. I think the most profound thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you're buying\nan appreciating asset, not a depreciating asset. - So that's a really\nimportant statement there because if hardware is capable enough, that's the hard thing to upgrade usually.\n- Yes, exactly. - Then the rest is a software problem-- - Yes, software has no\nmarginal cost really. - But, what's your intuition\non the software side? How hard are the remaining steps to get it to where the experience, not just the safety,\nbut the full experience is something that people would enjoy? - I think people it enjoy\nit very much so on highways. It's a total game changer\nfor quality of life, for using Tesla Autopilot on the highways. So it's really just\nextending that functionality to city streets, adding in\nthe traffic light recognition, navigating complex intersections, and then being able to navigate\ncomplicated parking lots so the car can exit a parking\nspace and come and find you, even if it's in a complete\nmaze of a parking lot. And, then it can just drop you off and find a parking spot, by itself. - Yeah, in terms of enjoyabilty,\nand something that people would actually find a lotta use from, the parking lot, it's rich of annoyance when you have to do it manually, so there's a lot of benefit to be gained from automation there. So, let me start injecting the human into this discussion a little bit. So let's talk about full autonomy, if you look at the current\nlevel four vehicles being tested on row like Waymo and so on, they're only technically autonomous, they're really level two systems with just a different design philosophy, because there's always a safety driver in almost all cases, and they're monitoring the system.\n- Right. - Do you see Tesla's full\nself-driving as still, for a time to come, requiring supervision of the human being. So its capabilities are\npowerful enough to drive but nevertheless requires a human to still be supervising, just like a safety driver is in other\nfully autonomous vehicles? - I think it will require\ndetecting hands on wheel for at least six months or\nsomething like that from here. Really it's a question of,\nfrom a regulatory standpoint, how much safer than a person\ndoes Autopilot need to be, for it to be okay to not monitor the car. And this is a debate that one can have, and then, but you need\na large amount of data, so that you can prove,\nwith high confidence, statistically speaking, that the car is dramatically safer than a person. And that adding in the person monitoring does not materially affect the safety. So it might need to be 200\nor 300% safer than a person. - And how do you prove that? - Incidents per mile. - Incidents per mile.\n- Yeah. - So crashes and fatalities-- - Yeah, fatalities would be a factor, but there are just not enough fatalities to be statistically significant, at scale. But there are enough crashes, there are far more crashes\nthen there are fatalities. So you can assess what is\nthe probability of a crash. Then there's another step\nwhich is probability of injury. And probability of permanent injury, the probability of death. And all of those need to be\nmuch better than a person, by at least, perhaps, 200%. - And you think there's\nthe ability to have a healthy discourse with\nthe regulatory bodies on this topic? - I mean, there's no\nquestion that regulators paid a disproportionate amount of attention to that which generates press, this is just an objective fact. And it also generates a lot of press. So, in the United States there's, I think, almost 40,000 automotive deaths per year. But if there are four in Tesla, they will probably receive\na thousand times more press than anyone else. - So the psychology of that\nis actually fascinating, I don't think we'll have enough time to talk about that, but I\nhave to talk to you about the human side of things. So, myself and our team\nat MIT recently released a paper on functional vigilance of drivers while using Autopilot. This is work we've been\ndoing since Autopilot was first released publicly,\nover three years ago, collecting video of driver\nfaces and driver body. So I saw that you tweeted\na quote from the abstract, so I can at least guess\nthat you've glanced at it. - Yeah, I read it. - Can I talk you through what we found? - Sure. - Okay, it appears that in\nthe data that we've collected, that drivers are maintaining\nfunctional vigilance such that, we're looking at 18,000\ndisengagements from Autopilot, 18,900, and annotating were they able to take over control in a timely manner. So they were there,\npresent, looking at the road to take over control, okay. So this goes against\nwhat many would predict from the body of literature\non vigilance with automation. Now the question is, do you think these results hold across\nthe broader population. So, ours is just a small subset. One of the criticism is that,\nthere's a small minority of drivers that may be highly responsible, where their vigilance\ndecrement would increase with Autopilot use. - I think this is all\nreally gonna be swept, I mean, the system's improving so much, so fast, that this is gonna\nbe a moot point very soon. Where vigilance is, if\nsomething's many times safer than a person, then adding a person does, the effect on safety is limited. And, in fact, it could be negative. - That's really interesting,\nso the fact that a human may, some percent of the population may exhibit a vigilance decrement, will not affect overall statistics, numbers on safety? - No, in fact, I think it will become, very, very quickly, maybe even\ntowards the end of this year, but I would say, I'd be\nshocked if it's not next year at the latest, that\nhaving a human intervene will decrease safety. Decrease, like imagine\nif you're in an elevator. Now it used to be that there\nwere elevator operators. And you couldn't go on\nan elevator by yourself and work the lever to move between floors. And now nobody wants an elevator operator, because the automated elevator\nthat stops at the floors is much safer than the elevator operator. And in fact it would be quite dangerous to have someone with a lever that can move the elevator between floors. - So, that's a really powerful statement, and a really interesting one, but I also have to ask\nfrom a user experience and from a safety perspective, one of the passions for me algorithmically is camera-based detection\nof just sensing the human, but detecting what the\ndriver's looking at, cognitive load, body pose,\non the computer vision side that's a fascinating problem. And there's many in industry who believe you have to have camera-based\ndriver monitoring. Do you think there could be benefit gained from driver monitoring? - If you have a system that's\nat or below a human level of reliability, then driver\nmonitoring makes sense. But if your system is dramatically better, more reliable than a human,\nthen driver monitoring does not help much. And, like I said, if you're in an elevator,\ndo you really want someone with a big\nlever, some random person operating the elevator between floors? I wouldn't trust that. I would rather have the buttons. - Okay, you're optimistic\nabout the pace of improvement of the system, from what you've seen with the full self-driving car computer. - The rate of improvement is exponential. - So, one of the other very interesting design choices early on\nthat connects to this, is the operational design\ndomain of Autopilot. So, where Autopilot is\nable to be turned on. So contrast another vehicle\nsystem that we were studying is the Cadillac Super\nCruise system that's, in terms of ODD, very constrained to particular kinds of highways, well mapped, tested,\nbut it's much narrower than the ODD of Tesla vehicles. - It's like ADD (both laugh). - Yeah, that's good, that's a good line. What was the design decision in that different philosophy of thinking, where there's pros and cons. What we see with a wide ODD is Tesla drivers are able to explore more the limitations of the system, at least early on, and they understand, together with the\ninstrument cluster display, they start to understand\nwhat are the capabilities, so that's a benefit. The con is you're letting drivers use it basically anywhere-- - Anywhere that it can\ndetect lanes with confidence. - Lanes, was there a philosophy, design decisions that were challenging, that were being made there? Or from the very beginning\nwas that done on purpose, with intent? - Frankly it's pretty crazy letting people drive a two-ton death machine manually. That's crazy, like, in the\nfuture will people be like, I can't believe anyone\nwas just allowed to drive one of these two-ton death machines, and they just drive wherever they wanted. Just like elevators, you could just move that elevator with that\nlever wherever you wanted, can stop it halfway\nbetween floors if you want. It's pretty crazy, so, it's gonna seem like a\nmad thing in the future that people were driving cars. - So I have a bunch of questions about the human psychology,\nabout behavior and so on-- - That's moot, it's totally moot. - Because you have faith in the AI system, not faith but, both on the hardware side and the deep learning approach\nof learning from data, will make it just far safer than humans. - Yeah, exactly. - Recently there were a few hackers, who tricked Autopilot to\nact in unexpected ways for the adversarial examples. So we all know that neural network systems are very sensitive to minor disturbances, these adversarial examples, on input. Do you think it's possible to defend against something like this, for the industry?\n- Sure (both laugh), yeah. - Can you elaborate on the\nconfidence behind that answer? - A neural net is just basically a bunch of matrix math. But you have to be a very sophisticated, somebody who really\nunderstands neural nets and basically reverse-engineer\nhow the matrix is being built, and then\ncreate a little thing that's just exactly causes the matrix math to be slightly off. But it's very easy to\nblock that by having, what would basically negative recognition, it's like if the system sees something that looks like a matrix hack, exclude it. It's such a easy thing to do. - So learn both on the valid\ndata and the invalid data, so basically learn on\nthe adversarial examples to be able to exclude them. - Yeah, you like basically wanna both know what is a car and what\nis definitely not a car. And you train for, this is a car, and this is definitely not a car. Those are two different things. People have no idea of neural nets really, They probably think neural nets involves, a fishing net or something (Lex laughs). - So, as you know, taking\na step beyond just Tesla and Autopilot, current\ndeep learning approaches still seem, in some ways, to be far from general\nintelligence systems. Do you think the current approaches will take us to general intelligence, or do totally new ideas\nneed to be invented? - I think we're missing a few key ideas for artificial general intelligence. But it's gonna be upon us very quickly, and then we'll need to\nfigure out what shall we do, if we even have that choice. It's amazing how people\ncan't differentiate between, say, the narrow\nAI that allows a car to figure out what a lane\nline is, and navigate streets, versus general intelligence. Like these are just very different things. Like your toaster and your\ncomputer are both machines, but one's much more\nsophisticated than another. - You're confident with\nTesla you can create the world's best toaster-- - The world's best toaster, yes. The world's best self-driving... yes, to me right now this\nseems game, set and match. I mean, I don't want us to be complacent or over-confident, but that's what it, that is just literally\nhow it appears right now, I could be wrong, but it\nappears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone. - Do you think we will ever create an AI system that we can\nlove, and loves us back in a deep meaningful way,\nlike in the movie Her? - I think AI will\ncapable of convincing you to fall in love with it very well. - And that's different than us humans? - You know, we start getting into a metaphysical question of, do emotions and thoughts exist in a different realm than the physical? And maybe they do, maybe\nthey don't, I don't know. But from a physics standpoint,\nI tend to think of things, you know, like physics was\nmy main sort of training, and from a physics\nstandpoint, essentially, if it loves you in a\nway that you can't tell whether it's real or not, it is real. - That's a physics view of love. - Yeah (laughs), if you\ncannot prove that it does not, if there's no test that you can apply that would make it, allow you to tell the difference, then there is no difference. - Right, and it's similar to\nseeing our world a simulation, they may not be a test to\ntell the difference between what the real world\n- Yes. - and the simulation, and therefore, from a physics perspective, it might as well be the same thing. - Yes, and there may\nbe ways to test whether it's a simulation, there might be, I'm not saying there aren't. But you could certainly imagine that a simulation could correct, that once an entity in\nthe simulation found a way to detect the simulation, it could either pause the simulation, start a new simulation, or\ndo one of many other things that then corrects for that error. - So when, maybe you,\nor somebody else creates an AGI system, and you get\nto ask her one question, what would that question be? - What's outside the simulation? - Elon, thank you so\nmuch for talking today, it's a pleasure. - All right, thank you.",
